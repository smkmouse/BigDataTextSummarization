Tuesday morning, NOAA Hurricane Hunters found the storm's maximum wind speeds are 175 mph. It now ranks among the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean. Forecasts suggest it will reach southern Florida and the Gulf of Mexico this weekend. Hurricane warnings have been issued for portions of the Leeward Islands and the Greater Antilles, including Puerto Rico. update. Over the weekend, the forecast track for this potentially devastating hurricane shifted south and west. It seems likely now that the storm will affect or strike the U.S. coast early next week, although meteorologists don't know exactly where. Florida and the Gulf Coast continue to be at risk. At 8 a.m. Irma will probably continue to be suppressed by the strong Atlantic high pressure beyond Wednesday, keeping the storm at major hurricane status and on a trajectory that places the storm in close proximity to Florida by next weekend. Potential U.S. impacts Forecasts from the European (top) and U.S. GFS (bottom) models Tuesday morning. It remains difficult to pinpoint if and where Irma will make landfall in the United States, but Florida is becoming the likely target. There is strong agreement in Irma's path through Friday, at which point Irma will probably be a major hurricane located just to the south of the Bahamas. The National Hurricane Center is forecasting tropical storm conditions to begin affecting Florida by Friday evening. All of the usual hazards are at play here; strong winds, heavy rain and dangerous storm surge. Storm surge may become the largest concern over the next few days, given the amount of time that Irma is spending over open water combined with the low-lying topography of southern Florida. Again, it should be noted that the forecast track for Irma will continue to change as we start to receive more aircraft data on the storm and as the large-scale environment features become more clear. At this point, residents from the gulf all the way to Maine should take special interest in forecast updates for Irma throughout the week. Brian Murphy contributed to this report.

All market data delayed 20 minutes. Irma remains a powerful Category 5 hurricane, the highest on the Saffir-Simspon Hurricane Wind Scale. Residents in Cuba and the Bahamas should be nearing completion on preparations for Irma. Hispaniola, Turks and Caicos Islands and southern Bahamas will face the brunt of Irma into Friday morning. The strongest winds are in the eye wall of the hurricane, which is expected to track near the Turks and Caicos and southern Bahamas through Friday night. As Irma continues to travel to the northwest through Saturday, northern Cuba and the central Bahamas will face the fury of powerful Irma. By Saturday night, Irma will turn to the north and will spread severe impacts into Florida and the central and northern Bahamas. Widespread power outages and significant damage to trees and structures are expected in these areas. The power may be out for weeks in some areas. Rough surf will spread outward from the storm and the strong winds from Irma will send a large and devastating storm surge across Turks and Caicos and Bahamas. In addition to damaging winds, Irma will also bring heavy rain over the next couple of days. In mountainous areas, especially Hispaniola and Cuba, flash flooding will be a much higher risk due to the water being funneled into valleys. There will also be a high risk for mudslides and road washouts. Weather conditions will improve on Friday for Hispaniola, and on Saturday for the Turks and Caicos and southern Bahamas as Irma pulls away. Dangerous weather conditions will begin to lessen on Sunday in Cuba, and on Monday for the northern and central Bahamas. Behind Irma, Hurricane Jose is churning about 800 miles east of the Lesser Antilles. Jose is expected to track to the west through the weekend and will eventually take a turn to the northwest. If Jose makes a close pass to the Leeward Islands, gusty winds and rain could impact islands that were battered by Irma. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes."}

The Category 3 storm was blamed for at least 19 deaths. Maria's next potential target was the Turks and Caicos Islands, which are still recovering from Hurricane Irma. On Wednesday, Maria barreled through Puerto Rico from end to end, knocking out all the power. It was the strongest hurricane to hit the U.S. commonwealth in more than 80 years. Officials said recovery will take months. A look at Hurricane Maria as it heads toward the Turks and Caicos islands on Thu., Sept. 21, 2017.

All times are Eastern unless otherwise noted. 12:39 a.m.: Maria taking its time approaching Turks and Caicos Hurricane Maria, still a Category 3 storm, is taking its time approaching the Turks and Caicos, the National Hurricane Center said. Dangerous high winds and torrential rains continued along the northern coast of the Dominican Republic as the storm slowly moves closer to Turks and Caicos. Maria's eye is expected to gradually move away from the northern coast of the Dominican Republic and then move near or just east of the Turks and Caicos Islands and southeastern Bahamas on Friday. Puerto Rico is still being lashed by rain, and flash flooding warnings continue. 10 p.m.: Trump speaks with Puerto Rico governor The White House says President Trump spoke with the governors of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire island of Puerto Rico was left without power after Maria knocked out its already weakened electrical grid. Mr. Trump said FEMA and other emergency responders are helping both U.S. territories begin the recovery process. He says he'll visit Puerto Rico. 8:30 p.m.: Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor eagerly awaits news of her family in Puerto Rico Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, whose family is from Puerto Rico, says she hasn't yet heard from half her family after Hurricane Maria walloped the island. Sotomayor, the high court's first Hispanic justice, was speaking Thursday at an event at the Newseum in Washington. She asked for the crowd's prayers for Puerto Rico but also the other islands, Texas and Florida that have been recently impacted by hurricanes. Sotomayor's parents immigrated to the United States from Puerto Rico before she was born. Sotomayor grew up in New York. 8 p.m.: Hurricane Maria's large eye gradually approaching Turks and Caicos Islands The National Hurricane Center (NHC) released its latest advisory tonight to say that Hurricane Maria is gradually nearing the Turks and Caicos Islands with sustained winds of 125 mph -- a slight uptick from the 120 mph winds earlier in the night. Maria remains a Category 3 hurricane. A look at Hurricane Maria's projected path as seen from the National Hurricane Center's 8 p.m. advisory on Thu., Sept. 21, 2017. U.S. National Hurricane Center Maria is moving toward the northwest near 9 mph, NHC says, and the eye will continue to pass offshore of the northern coast of the Dominican Republic this evening, and then move near or just east of the Turks and Caicos Islands and southeastern Bahamas later tonight and on Friday. NHC says an additional 4 to 8 inches of rain is expected in Puerto Rico and an isolated maximum storm total totaling 40 inches. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the central Bahamas beginning late Friday. 6:40 p.m.: Residents should expect prospect of weeks without power or longer A day after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, flooding towns, crushing homes and killing at least two people, millions of people on the island faced the dispiriting prospect of weeks and perhaps months without electricity. The storm knocked out the entire grid across the U.S. territory of 3.4 million, leaving many without power to light their homes, cook, pump water or run fans, air conditioners or refrigerators. Now many are hunting for gas canisters for cooking, collecting rainwater or steeling themselves mentally for the hardships to come in the tropical heat. Some are even contemplating leaving the island. Like many Puerto Ricans, Llanos does not have a generator or gas stove. 5:50 p.m.: Power industry executive refuses to speculate on when power will be restored in Puerto Rico Puerto Rico's government hired 56 small contractors to clear trees and put up new power lines and poles and will be sending tanker trucks to supply neighborhoods as they run out of water. The entire island was declared federal disaster zones. Mike Hyland, senior vice president of engineering services for the American Public Power Association, a utility industry group that is sending repair crews into the Caribbean, refused to speculate on how long it would take to restore power. The storm knocked out the entire grid across the U.S. territory of 3.4 million, leaving many without power to light their homes, cook, pump water or run fans, air conditioners or refrigerators. 5:15 p.m.: Flash flood warnings continue in portions of Puerto Rico due to persistent heavy rainfall The National Hurricane Center (NHC) released its latest advisory to report that catastrophic flooding is occurring in Puerto Rico -- and everyone on the island should continue to follow advice from local officials to avoid life-threatening flooding conditions. Hurricane Maria is moving northwest near 9 mph with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph. Maria's eye will continue to pass offshore of the northern coast of the Dominican Republic this evening and then move near or just east of the Turks and Caicos Islands and southeastern Bahamas tonight and Friday. Swells from Hurricane Maria are expected to begin reaching the coast of the southeastern United States on Friday which could cause dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents along the coast for several days even though Maria is forecast to stay well offshore in the western Atlantic Ocean, NHC says. 4:03 p.m.: Puerto Rico surveys extent of Maria's wrath Rescuers fanned out to reach stunned victims Thursday after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, knocking out electricity to the entire island and triggering landslides and floods. The extent of the damage is unknown given that dozens of municipalities remained isolated and without communication after Maria hit the island Wednesday morning as a Category 4 storm with 155 mph winds, the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in over 80 years. Uprooted trees and widespread flooding blocked many highways and streets across the island of 3.4 million residents, creating a maze that forced drivers to go against traffic and past police cars that used loudspeakers to warn people they must respect a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew imposed by the governor to ensure everyone's safety. People resorted to rafts and kayaks to get around because flooding made many roads remained impassable.

Hurricane Jose was 700 miles east of Florida at midday Tuesday, September 12, 2017, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, making it a Category 1 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. (Credit: CNN) Hurricane Jose was 840 miles east of Florida early Wednesday, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, making it a Category 1 storm. However, most computer models indicate Jose will stay out to sea and complete a tight enough loop to avoid moving onshore. Such a path is concerning in the wake of Hurricane Irma, which has altered the beach landscape and made it more vulnerable to coastal erosion and flooding. In a pocket of weak steering winds in the open Atlantic, Jose is expected to make a clockwise loop. It will initially move farther away from the United States before coming closer to the Bahamas and East Coast. The strength and location of this ridge will determine how far Jose moves westward before eventually turning north and then east again. There is generally not a dominant weather feature that is steering the storm, so model forecasts can vary widely between each other and from run to run. Still, the cone of uncertainty comes uncomfortably close, within 200 miles of Florida and 50 miles from the Bahamas. The storm may bring a high risk of rip currents, too. Jose already has threatened other hurricane-weary countries. Tropical storm-force winds from Jose spread over the islands on Saturday. Only three days earlier, Antigua and Barbuda had been devastated by a peak-strength Category 5 Irma, packing 185-mph winds. But with Harvey and Irma, it has now experienced two Category 4 landfalls in 16 days. If history is a guide, more will be on the way. The full hurricane season lasts until November 30, although the peak season generally stretches from about mid-August to mid-October. But hurricanes into November and even December are not unheard of. Trademark and Copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.

The storm killed more than 1,000 people in Haiti, and at least 27 in the U.S. - more than half of them in North Carolina. Photo: Vehicles at a business are surrounded by floodwaters from Hurricane Matthew in Lumberton, North Carolina Wednesday, October 12, 2016. People were ordered to evacuate, and officials warned that some communities could be cut off by washed out roads or bridge closures. Thousands of homes have been damaged in North Carolina as a result of the storm and many are still under threat of flooding. Patricia and her husband Ron fled their home in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and sought shelter in Lumberton, only to have their car get caught in the floodwaters. Health authorities have warned that Hurricane Matthew has created conditions that are likely to cause an increase in the deadly waterborne cholera virus. Nearly a week after the storm smashed into southwestern Haiti, some communities along the southern coast have yet to receive any assistance, leaving residents who have lost their homes and virtually all of their belongings struggling to find shelter and potable water.

Hurricane Matthew passed by offshore as a Category 3 hurricane bringing heavy winds and minor flooding. Some three million people on the U.S. southeast coast faced an urgent evacuation order Thursday as Hurricane Matthew bore down on Florida. Matthew hit them as a Category Four hurricane but has since been downgraded to three, on a scale of five, by the US National Hurricane Center. The first evacuations were ordered in the United States as coastal residents prepared to escape the approaching monster storm, expected off the East Coast later this week. The dangerous Category 4 storm blew ashore around dawn in Haiti. It unloaded heavy rain as it swirled on toward a lightly populated part of Cuba and the Bahamas. Hurricane Matthew roared into the southwestern coast of the island of Hispaniola with devastating storm conditions as it headed north toward Cuba and the eastern coast of Florida. As the Category 4 hurricane creeps closer, Cuba, in the likely path of destruction, ordered the evacuation of more than 250,000 people from the east of the island. Hurricane Matthew took aim at densely populated Haiti and Jamaica on Monday, packing winds that could sweep away flimsy buildings and bringing torrential rain that could trigger deadly landslides and floods.

But when asked about people in South Florida who intend to ride out the storm at home, Long was blunt. Mark DeMaria, acting deputy director of the hurricane center, said Friday afternoon that the latest models showed the storm track shifting slightly to the west, putting southwest Florida in particular jeopardy for the most violent winds, while all of South Florida will have significant impacts. In addition to having intense power, Irma also is an immense storm, with forecasters reporting hurricane-force winds extending some 70 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extending as far as 195 miles out. Publix, a grocery-store chain, announced plans to close stores across the state in waves and did not say when they would reopen. Tom Bossert, homeland security adviser to President Trump, on Friday said that people need to have enough food and water to get by during a period when the rain and wind will prevent authorities from getting to them.

At least 25 deaths had been blamed on the powerful storm during its weeklong march across the Caribbean, 19 of them in Haiti. The mayor of Petit Goave, a coastal community west of the capital Port-au-Prince, told NBC News 14 people had died there, and the country's Civil Agency has confirmed five people dead with another missing. Two days after the hurricane rampaged across Haiti's remote southwestern peninsula with roaring winds and flooding rains, local authorities and international aid workers still lack a clear picture of the storm's destruction. Dramatic Images From Hurricane Matthew AP But the weather began calming Wednesday and a way was found around a key bridge that was washed away, allowing convoys and helicopters to start ventruing to marooned corners to assess the damage and determine how to help thousands of people who lost homes, livestock and crops. The last Category 4 storm to pound Haiti was Hurricane Flora in 1963, which killed as many as 8,000 people. UpdatedDeath Toll Rises as Haiti Digs Out From Hurricane Matthew Still, Mourad Wahba, the U.N. secretary-general's deputy special representative for Haiti, called the hurricane the biggest humanitarian crisis in Haiti since the devastating earthquake of 2010. Additionally, four people were killed because of the storm in the Dominican Republic and one each in Colombia and the Carribbean (where a boulder fell on a 16-year-old boy in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines). Tropical storm conditions began spreading over the southeastern Bahamas early Thursday, and Bahamas Prime Minister Perry Christie voiced concern about the potential impact on the sprawling archipelago off Florida's east coast. Hurricane Matthew Smashes Haiti Footage of the gale-force winds in Les Cayes, Haiti. There was growing concern on the U.S. East Coast, where nearly two million people were told to evacuate given the threat of Matthew's storm surge up the length of the Bahamas. People raced to supermarkets, gas stations and hardware stores, buying up groceries, water, plywood, tarps, batteries and propane. Gov. Scott urged coastal residents to prepare for the possibility of a direct hit and line up three days' worth of food, water and medicine. The White House said relief supplies were being moved to emergency staging areas in the Southeast. The slow-moving storm was expected to drench the coast from the Florida Keys through central Florida, bring storm surge up to 5 feet deep along the Atlantic coast and possibly spawn tornadoes. Even if Matthew doesn't come ashore, its tropical storm-force winds could reach the state. Mandatory evacuations were already underway in Brevard County, and voluntary evacuations have been activated in St. Lucie County, but Gov. Scott urged other coastal residents potentially in harm's way not to wait to be told to leave. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley ordered residents in Charleston and Beaufort counties to leave on Wednesday ahead of the hurricane. She said evacuations in Georgetown and Horry counties will come on Thursday. Several cruise ships were rerouted from their scheduled trips to the Caribbeans and Bahamas to Key West, about 40 miles south of the portion of Florida currently not under a tropical storm warning. VideoHurricane Matthew Quiets Campaign Ahead of Debate Matthew was at one point a Category 5 storm, making it the most powerful hurricane in the region in nearly a decade. It blew ashore around dawn Tuesday in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and a place where many people live in shacks of wood or concrete blocks. In Haiti, where international aid efforts were stymied Tuesday because of the lack of access to the hardest-hit areas, many residents of flooded areas seen by Associated Press reporters were wading through shin-high waters. Muddy rivers and tributaries continued to rise as water flowed down hillsides and mountains, making more flash floods and mudslides possible even as Matthew tracked away from the country. NOAA Crew Flies Into Eye of Hurricane Matthew A flight crew from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) flew into the eye of Hurricane Matthew on Oct. 6. The video shows crew members flying in very turbulent conditions into the center of the storm, which spun dangerously close to Florida's Atlantic coast Friday morning, scraping the shore with howling wind and heavy rain and that left more than 400,000 without power. from loading.

Irma's fierce winds ripped off the roof of the Roy Schneider Medical Center on St. Thomas, and the local authorities were working Thursday to evacuate patients to the island of St. Croix via helicopter, Plaskett said. No fatalities have been reported, but Plaskett said officials still are assessing damage. The islands' 911 emergency system is down, she said, and still-rough seas and damage to St. Thomas' airport also complicate recovery efforts. Officials are working to clear the runway of debris. On Thursday afternoon, President Trump approved a disaster declaration for the territory, a step designed to speed federal aid to St. Thomas and St. John. Residents who still had Internet access took to social media to report lashing winds as the storm spun over St. Thomas and a wrecked landscape of twisted galvanized roofing, smashed cars and toppled trees in Irma's aftermath. These islands, a tourist mecca often called America's Paradise, have been hit by powerful hurricanes before, most notably Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Hurricane Marilyn in 1995. Relatives of Virgin Islanders took to Facebook, including USVI Hurricane Irma Alert, seeking updates on family members. St. Croix, the largest of the U.S. Virgin Islands, lies roughly 40 miles south of St. Thomas and sustained far less damage, although residents report downed trees and power outages. Wasp was the first to arrive near the Virgin Islands, and its helicopters are helping evacuate critically ill patients from St. Thomas to St. Croix and assess hurricane damage from the air, officials said. Hurricane Irma ravaged parts of the U.S. Virgin Islands. This image shows St. Thomas.

Residents who aren't under mandatory evacuation orders have been warned to remain vigilant and be prepared to outmaneuver the storm, depending on its track.

Many residents found long gas lines Wednesday. But so far, the state isn't running short on supplies, Scott said. Airline passengers were urged to call before leaving for the airport. Florida airports had canceled hundreds of flights, most of them in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Orlando. Fort Lauderdale closed its airport, airlines suspended operations in Miami, and Orlando's airport was slated to close at 8 p.m. Thursday, airport officials said.

Mandatory evacuations in South Carolina Cars packed highways in South Carolina, where officials gave mandatory evacuation orders for several counties. Close to half a million people were expected to have evacuated by Thursday, said Kim Stenson, director of South Carolina Emergency Management. Tempers apparently flared during the slow traffic. A man got out of his truck at a detour, removed a traffic cone and sped away. A police chase ended in a shootout that left the man in the hospital, Berkeley County Chief Deputy Mike Cochran said. His condition is unknown. The South Carolina Department of Transportation changed the directions of eastbound traffic lanes to accommodate the exodus of people leaving coastal cities like Charleston.

Other eastern Florida population centers soon could be ordered to evacuate, too, depending on Irma's path. Its eye was due to be near Miami early Sunday.

Emergency fuel deliveries made Fuel availability had become a major problem, with only about half of Miami's gas stations open, CNN's Miguel Marquez said. At a Marathon gas station in Miami, a line of cars wrapped around the corner, and two police officers kept drivers in line, with police tape stopping them from skipping ahead. Drivers had to wait at least an hour for fuel. Emergency contractors by Thursday had secured 1.5 million gallons of fuel, with about 300,000 more barrels of fuel being unloaded from a ship in Tampa to resupply gas stations. A fuel ship from Mississippi was heading to the Port of Tampa and was due to get a military escort, he said. Scott also suspending toll collections for the duration of the storm. Limited evacuation routes A mass evacuation in Florida relies on two primary highways: I-95 along the east coast and I-75 further west. By Friday morning, Irma's cone of potential landfall included almost the entire state of Florida, meaning residents would not be able to flee to the state's Gulf Coast to avoid its wrath. That left a trek north as the best choice. Tropical storm-force winds from Irma covered more than 65,000 square miles -- about the area of all of Florida. Memories of rough evacuations linger Gridlock on Florida roads harked back to chaotic evacuation attempts ahead of Hurricane Floyd, which aimed for Florida before turning north and weakening in 1999, and Hurricane Rita, which hit near the Texas-Louisiana border in 2005. When Harvey threatened southeast Texas about two weeks ago, Houston officials opted not to issue mandatory evacuation orders, partly owing to lessons learned from those past problems, they said. Instead, Houston residents were told to hunker down in their homes. But the alternative could have been worse, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said.

ET Monday Irma has weakened since beginning its push up central Florida, but is still a Category 1 hurricane with winds near 75 mph and higher gusts, according to the National Hurricane Center. Its center is about 60 miles north of Tampa and continues to move along the northwest coast of the Florida peninsula. The NHC says Irma is expected to weaken to a tropical storm this morning and tropical depression by Tuesday afternoon. Irma's hurricane force winds extend at least 60 miles from the storm's center and tropical storm force winds extend as far as 415 miles. The hurricane is forecast to reach the southeastern United States later tonight. The NHC warns coastal areas could see rising water moving inland over the next 36 hours. ET. As the eye of Hurricane Irma skirts southwest Florida, just look at the rainfall falling all across the state. This storm is big. Miami International Airport announced it will remain closed to passenger flights at least through Monday, though some airlines will fly personnel to the airport in preparation for reopening. Gov. Rick Scott warned that it would be storm surge, more so than winds or power outages, that would likely be the most dangerous aspect of Irma over the coming days. Districtwide, the South Florida Water Management District projected between 5.5 and 6 inches of rain for Sunday. That amount would top the single-day record of 5.35 inches, set by Tropical Storm Mitch in November 1998. On Sunday, Collier and Lee counties were expected to see the heaviest rainfall, with an average of 8-12 inches. President Trump granted a major disaster declaration to assist with recovery efforts in Florida, the White House said in a statement, approving Gov. Rick Scott's request for federal assistance earlier Sunday. A beaten path through the Florida Keys Irma plowed into the lower Florida Keys early Sunday morning, its eye passing just 20 miles east of Key West.

A Twitter user posted video that purported to show the scene in Key West: Impact on the mainland The fence of reporter Tyler Kline's neighbor, stripped of its wood because there was no plywood left to board up the house. After restoring more than 300,000 outages, main provider Florida Power & Light says Irma has left roughly 1.7 million of its customers without power, and the state's Division of Emergency Management says its more than 609 shelters are filling with an evacuee population stretching into the six digits. For others, like a Tampa neighbor of WUSF's Tyler Kline, preparations meant pulling wood from their own fence just to board up their windows. Some gas stations in South Florida ran out of fuel and couldn't keep up with demand. As Gov. Scott noted, some of the greatest concern rests with the expected storm surge. The National Hurricane Center warned it could reach as high as 10 to 15 feet in the coastal area spanning from Cape Sable and Captiva on Florida's southwestern coast. Most of the coast of the entire state was under storm surge warnings, as well. He added that storm surge flooding is responsible for more than half of the deaths during hurricanes. Maps show it later touching parts of Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee. For now, though, residents in western Florida are scrambling to prepare. Residents in Miami had been expecting the brunt of the storm, but the storm's expected path then shifted to the northwest, taking many people by surprise. Isolated tornadoes are common with Hurricanes. Deadly car crash Earlier on Sunday morning in Hardy County, while some were still preparing for Irma, a sheriff's deputy and a corrections officer died following a car crash. Hardee County Sheriff Arnold Lanier confirmed the deaths with NPR. Deputy Julie Bridges, 42, was driving her patrol car on her way home to pick up supplies for an evacuation shelter where she'd been working. About 6:45 a.m. Bridges' car crashed into another vehicle driven by a corrections officer who was on his way to work, according to Lanier. Bridges was a 13-year veteran of the sheriff's office. Meanwhile, the National Weather Service has warned of tornadoes, especially east of the hurricane's path. President Trump has been keeping abreast of the storm Sunday, speaking with the governors of Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee, according to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

Gov. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) has already declared a state of emergency for the Sunshine State, posting on Twitter Tuesday that President Donald Trump has offered full government resources. Scott said he activated 100 National Guard members, plus another 7,000 available for Friday morning, as well. Miami-Dade County and Monroe County also announced partial evacuations for as early as Wednesday morning. It is currently over the Atlantic, around 270 miles east of Antigua and Barbuda, and it is heading west across the Caribbean at an average speed of around 14 miles per hour. It is then predicted to affect the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Wednesday afternoon. After that it could turn toward the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Cuba, and then Florida. Authorities have warned that the storm could create up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain, cause landslides and flash floods and generate waves of up to 23 feet (seven meters) across the region, the Associated Press reports. Weather expects are predicting that Irma will reach the Florida keys and portions of the Florida Peninsula by the weekend, with mandatory evacuation for the Florida Keys and Miami-Dade set to begin Wednesday. The last Category 5 Hurricane to make landfall in Florida was Hurricane Andrew 25 years ago. The storm destroyed more than 25,000 homes, damaged 100,000 others and directly killed 15 people, according to USA Today.

That's where he was in September when Hurricane Irma roared through. The National Hurricane Center says Irma had sustained winds of 185 mph when it hit the Virgin Islands with gusts of 200 mph or higher. They were the most powerful winds ever recorded in that part of the Caribbean. National Virgin Islands Still Recovering From 2017 Hurricanes As New Season Begins In his more than 30 years on St. John, Krall has hunkered down for many hurricanes, including other Category 5 storms. He says Irma's winds were dramatically worse than other hurricanes. He knows what winds are like at 150 mph. Irma's winds, he says, were much different. It's extremely intense. Krall says you can prepare for 185 mph winds. He's a carpenter who built and reinforced his house himself to withstand hurricanes. His home came through Irma with just minor damage. But, he and many others in the Virgin Islands believe Irma should have been designated as a Category 6 storm. Currently, the Saffir-Simpson scale, developed in the early '70s by two scientists after whom it was named, only goes up to Category 5, for storms with winds of 157 mph or higher. Scientists say there's evidence hurricanes are getting stronger because of climate change. A new study from the National Center for Atmospheric Research says with rising global temperatures, hurricanes may bring more rain, move more slowly and have higher wind speeds. With that in mind, Mike Mann, an atmospheric science professor at Penn State University, thinks it's time to add a new designation, Category 6, to describe more powerful hurricanes, like Irma. It's a proposal Chris Davis, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., has heard before. It's come up after other powerful storms such as Hurricane Allen in 1980 and Hurricane Gilbert in 1988. That's also the position of researchers at the National Hurricane Center. The purpose of the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale they say is to communicate the level of risk to the public. In hurricanes, Davis says, it's not wind that causes the most deaths, but water. National Lessons From Hurricane Irma: When To Evacuate And When To Shelter In Place There's a growing consensus among atmospheric scientists, although not all are convinced, that hurricanes are getting stronger. In the past three years, the world has seen the strongest wind speeds ever measured in a tropical cyclone in the Pacific, Patricia; the strongest in the southern hemisphere, Winston; and the strongest in the open Atlantic, Hurricane Irma. Mann says as the storms become more powerful, the danger to the public increases. In the Virgin Islands, Tom Krall says most people don't evacuate even in a Category 5 storm. But storms like Irma require special measures."}

WATCH: Predicting where Hurricane Irma will hit when it reaches the U.S. But because of the uncertainty in any forecast this far out, state and local authorities in Miami and Fort Lauderdale held off for the time being on ordering any widespread evacuations there. Amid the dire forecasts and the devastating damage done by Hurricane Harvey less than two weeks ago in Houston, some people who usually ride out storms in Florida seemed unwilling to risk it this time. Still, she was undecided about going and worried about getting stuck in traffic and running out of gas. WATCH: Hurricane Irma hitting British Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico In Miami, the deputy director of the Building Department, Maurice Pons, said that there about two dozen such cranes in the city alone and that they were built to withstand winds up to 145 mph, but not a Category 5 hurricane. As people rushed to buy up water and other supplies, board up their homes with plywood and fill up their cars, Scott declared a state of emergency and asked the governors of Alabama and Georgia to waive trucking regulations so gasoline tankers can get fuel into Florida quickly to ease shortages. Scott said he anticipates gas stations being restocked by Thursday morning and urged people to take only what they need when fueling up. It was at the time the most expensive natural disaster in U.S. history. University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy said Irma could easily prove the costliest storm in U.S. history. WATCH: Amateur video shows Hurricane Irma hitting Virgin Islands Jeff Masters, director of the Weather Underground forecasting service, warned that high winds and large storm surges will damage expensive properties from Miami to Charleston, South Carolina. While Florida building codes were tightened and enforced more stringently after Andrew, the population since then has grown, coastal development has continued, and climate change has become more pronounced. Under 2001 rules, housing in most parts of Florida must be built to withstand a Category 3 hurricane, meaning winds of up to 129 mph. Miami-Dade and Broward counties have more stringent building codes requiring some structures to withstand Category 4 winds of 146 mph and 140 mph respectively.

Irma is now a major Category 3 hurricane as it moves across the Atlantic Kevin Loria Aug. 31, 2017, 4:52 PM createPerformanceMark('first image displayed'); National Hurricane Center Hurricane Irma is intensifying as it makes its way across the Atlantic. It's now a major Category 3 storm, according to the National Hurricane Center. It's too early to know whether the storm will make landfall in the Caribbean, Mexico, or the US, though some models suggest it could head toward the Eastern seaboard or Gulf of Mexico. Irma has captured the attention of meteorologists, since it has the potential to become a Category 4 or even a Category 5 storm before reaching the Antilles next week. An analysis of Irma early Thursday morning showed 70 mph winds, making it a tropical storm. But by 11 a.m., sustained wind speeds had jumped to almost 100 mph with some higher gusts, causing it to become a Category 2 hurricane. But certain projections show that a more direct path toward land is possible. A few models suggest Irma could head towards the East Coast. The storm could put us far ahead of the average accumulated cyclone energy (a measure of the energy of tropical cyclone systems) for this time of year, he said. Both CSU and The Weather Company predicted an unusually active hurricane season this year. Irma is the fourth hurricane of 2017, but the average date of the fourth hurricane in a year is September 21. The peak of the season is around September 10. Klotzbach said half of the season's cyclone energy usually occurs in September, meaning major hurricanes are likely still to come. Forecasters will have a better idea of what to expect from the hurricane b the middle of next week. At the same time, meteorologists are also monitoring a disturbance in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico that could bring additional rainfall to the already flooded Texas and Louisiana coasts sometime early next week.

Irma has killed at least 24 people in the Caribbean, leaving officials scrambling to bring aid to shattered communities. Angela FritzWashington Post As a meteorologist, there are things you learn in textbooks that you may never see in person. You know they happen theoretically, but the chances of seeing the most extraordinary weather phenomena are slim to none. The wind on Long Island in the Bahamas is from the southeast to the northwest on Saturday. On the northwest side of the island, it would be blowing the water away from the shoreline. In the center of the storm, where there is extreme low pressure, water is drawn upward. As the storm draws water toward the center, it gets pulled away from the surroundings. In any case, this isn't the sign of a tsunami. The water will return to Long Island, and it probably won't rush back with any great force. It will probably be back by Sunday afternoon. Hurricane Irma, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane in recorded history, hit the islands of the northeast Caribbean on Sept. 6, 2017, before roaring along a path to Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Florida.

Earlier, it was the most powerful recorded storm in the open Atlantic. But as the once-Category 5 storm neared the U.S. mainland, it lost some oomph after running into the northern coast of Cuba. Still, at about 400 miles (640 kilometres) wide, it raked much of the state with devastating storm surge, destructive winds and drenching rains. Florida can thank Cuba, where it did hit as a Category 5 storm, said Maue and Jeff Masters, meteorology director for Weather Underground. And even hitting the Tampa region from land to the south instead of from open water will reduce storm surge ever so slightly, Masters said. When Irma passed over the Florida Keys Sunday morning its central pressure was the seventh lowest for a smack into the United States. Irma ties the killer 1928 Lake Okeechobee hurricane. Irma set plenty of records, according to a two-page list compiled by Colorado State University researcher Phil Klotzbach: Its 185 mph (297 kph) winds were the highest on record for the open Atlantic ocean, outside the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean sea. It spent three consecutive days as a top-of-the-scale Category 5 hurricane, the longest in the satellite era. Irma generated about as much as energy as entire normal Atlantic hurricane season. It was the strongest storm to hit the Leeward Islands. Please read our Commenting Policy first. All rights reserved. result found. results found."}

More than 600,000 residents from Miami-Dade, the county that encloses the fourth most populous city in the US, were under evacuation orders. The city was scheduled to impose a curfew from 7pm on Saturday to 8am on Sunday. Broward County further to the north had imposed an even more stringent curfew, starting at 4pm in an attempt to propel the last stragglers in a largely deserted area behind closed doors as the hurricane hit. Tropical storm-force winds of more than 50mph were expected to pummel the region from about 5pm on Saturday. Forty-two shelters were open across the Miami area, with 11 already full as more than 25,000 people hunkered down, temporary refugees from the storm. The shelter program was not without its glitches or critics. Refuges were opened at a faster pace than volunteers could be found to staff them, and in some cases evacuees were turned away amid scenes of confusion. Thousands like us left and went to Naples and Tampa on the west coast. Within 24 hours everything had changed Francisco Esser Many of the shelters were located in high schools, which had turned their sports halls and assembly spaces over to thousands of evacuees. Media were being prevented from entering one such shelter, at the Ronald Reagan high school in Doral, near Miami airport. But evacuees staying at the school told the Guardian conditions inside, for about 1,200 people, were holding up and spirits were high. Families seeking shelter were told to bring their own bedding and sufficient food and water for three days. Some people were rather zealous in how they interpreted that advice. Shelter organizers in Broward County put out a subsidiary notice that large objects should not be brought in, following reports that some people had turned up with king-sized mattresses and refrigerators. In the west, as the storm approached Tampa Bay, people who had already entered shelters said they were trying to adjust to their new reality. Millions flee from Hurricane Irma's path as Florida prepares for deadly hit Read more As the path of Irma veered, hundreds of thousands of Floridians found themselves caught in the changing patterns of a major weather system. Many people from the Miami area fled north and west under evacuation orders, only to find they had been swept into the westward track of the hurricane. Francisco Esser, 44, evacuated Miami on Thursday with his wife and two young children, making a four-hour drive to Tampa. Then, as he avidly followed the news on the Weather Channel and from the National Hurricane Center, he realized that one of the most heavily threatened regions was precisely the one he had evacuated into. So on Saturday, at 5am, the family got back into their car and drove the reverse four-hour journey to their home in Miami. They were unpacking when they spoke to the Guardian."}

People were ordered to evacuate, and officials warned that some communities could be cut off by washed out roads or bridge closures. Thousands of homes have been damaged in North Carolina as a result of the storm and many are still under threat of flooding. Patricia and her husband Ron fled their home in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and sought shelter in Lumberton, only to have their car get caught in the floodwaters. Health authorities have warned that Hurricane Matthew has created conditions that are likely to cause an increase in the deadly waterborne cholera virus. Nearly a week after the storm smashed into southwestern Haiti, some communities along the southern coast have yet to receive any assistance, leaving residents who have lost their homes and virtually all of their belongings struggling to find shelter and potable water.

Hurricane Matthew passed by offshore as a Category 3 hurricane bringing heavy winds and minor flooding. Some three million people on the U.S. southeast coast faced an urgent evacuation order Thursday as Hurricane Matthew bore down on Florida. Matthew hit them as a Category Four hurricane but has since been downgraded to three, on a scale of five, by the US National Hurricane Center. The first evacuations were ordered in the United States as coastal residents prepared to escape the approaching monster storm, expected off the East Coast later this week. The dangerous Category 4 storm blew ashore around dawn in Haiti. It unloaded heavy rain as it swirled on toward a lightly populated part of Cuba and the Bahamas. Hurricane Matthew roared into the southwestern coast of the island of Hispaniola with devastating storm conditions as it headed north toward Cuba and the eastern coast of Florida. As the Category 4 hurricane creeps closer, Cuba, in the likely path of destruction, ordered the evacuation of more than 250,000 people from the east of the island. Hurricane Matthew took aim at densely populated Haiti and Jamaica on Monday, packing winds that could sweep away flimsy buildings and bringing torrential rain that could trigger deadly landslides and floods. As the powerful storm churned north, officials in both countries scrambled to protect buildings and move people out of danger zones to shelters. All rights reserved."}

The storm, tied for the second-strongest ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, is headed for the southeastern Bahamas and, by the weekend and early next week, Florida and the Southeast United States. It added hurricanes watches would be issued for parts of the Florida Keys and Florida Peninsula late Thursday morning. Preparations should be rushed to completion along and near its projected path, including over South Florida. At 5 a.m. Its peak winds were estimated at 180 miles per hour, a slight decrease in strength from Wednesday. The storm's heavier rain bands which had been lashing Puerto Rico into Wednesday evening had retreated to the northwest and just scattered showers lingered Thursday morning. In a bit of fortunate news, the storm's eyewall, the region with the most destructive winds, had passed to its north. With the storm heading west-northwest, hurricane warnings were in effect for the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos, Haiti and the Bahamas. A hurricane watch covered Cuba. It will produce the full gamut of hurricane hazards across the Bahamas and potentially South Florida, including a devastating storm surge, destructive winds and dangerous flash flooding. Meanwhile, two new hurricanes formed late Wednesday afternoon in the Atlantic basin: Jose in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and Katia in the southwest Gulf of Mexico (see more information down below). But enough uncertainty in the track exists that all of Florida should be on the highest alert and preparing for this hurricane. Some of the computer simulations on Wednesday tracked the storm center very near Southeast Florida Sunday morning, which would present a very dangerous situation for the Miami to Fort Lauderdale area. However, shifts in the storm track are likely. Model simulations of the center of Irma at 2 p.m. Sunday. Tropical-storm-force winds are likely to arrive in Florida on Saturday, with the worst storm conditions occurring Sunday. The most extreme conditions are likely to occur near the storm center, but it is impossible this far out to pinpoint exactly where that will track. And serious storm effects will expand well outside the center. The entire Florida peninsula is only about 100 miles wide, small compared to the size of the storm. Tropical-storm-force winds presently extend outward up to 185 miles from the storm center and hurricane-force winds extend 50 miles away. Saffir-Simpson category rating of a hurricane only refers to peak winds in eyewall. Remember, the category rating only refers to the peak winds in the eyewall, not the size of the storm, the rainfall and the storm surge. The rainfall forecast for the coming week shows a heavy swath over the Florida peninsula, and then spreading northward into the Carolinas as Irma likely tracks over those areas early next week. A flash flooding warning was also issued. The Hurricane Center provides this description of the potential damage inflicted by Category 5 winds: A high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months. As the storm passes just north of the Dominican Republic and Haiti on Thursday, hurricane-force winds and torrential rains are possible. Later on Thursday, the storm will near the Turks and Caicos and southeastern Bahamas, where it could push ashore a devastating storm surge of 15 to 20 feet above normally dry land. Irma's path through the Northern Lesser Antilles Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the hurricane passed directly over Barbuda and Saint Martin in the northern Leeward Islands, the strongest hurricane ever recorded in that region and tied with the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane as the strongest Atlantic storm to strike land. As Barbuda took a direct hit, the weather station there clocked a wind gust to 155 mph before it went offline. The storm surge on the island, or the rise in water above normally dry land, reached at least 8 feet. Widespread destruction was reported on the island. The storm also passed directly over Anguilla and St. Martin early Wednesday, causing severe damage. Among the most intense storms on record, it only trails Hurricane Allen in 1980, which had winds of 190 mph. It is tied for second most intense with Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane. The storm has maintained maximum wind speeds of at least 185 mph longer than any other storm on Earth in recorded history. Late Tuesday night, its pressure dropped to 914 millibars (the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm), ranking as the lowest of any storm on record outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the Atlantic basin. The storm has generated the most Accumulated Cyclone Energy, a measure of both a storm's duration and intensity, of any hurricane on record. Without a doubt, the World Meteorological Organization will retire the names Harvey and Irma after this season. Two Category 4 hurricanes hit in Texas and Louisiana six weeks apart that year. Credit to tropical weather expert and occasional Capital Weather Gang contributor Phil Klotzbach for some of the statistics in this section. Hurricanes Jose and Katia While Irma is grabbing all of the attention, two other hurricanes are spinning in the Atlantic basin: Tropical Storm Jose was upgraded to a hurricane late Wednesday afternoon. Positioned far out in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the storm was rapidly gaining strength and was forecast to become a major Category 3 storm by Friday. The current track forecast keeps it mostly away from land areas over the next couple of days but brings it close to the same islands in the northeastern Lesser Antilles slammed by Irma this weekend and forecasters will be watching it closely. Tropical Storm Katia, which formed early Wednesday in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, intensified quickly into a hurricane late Wednesday afternoon. It could intensify into a Category 2 hurricane before making landfall in the Mexico state of Veracruz Friday into Saturday, where a hurricane warning is in effect. And now we also have Jose and Katia adding to the tally. He earned a master's degree in atmospheric science and spent 10 years as a climate change science analyst for the U.S. government. He holds the Digital Seal of Approval from the National Weather Association. His website hosted at RSMAS is also quite popular during hurricane season."}

The fourth hurricane of 2017, Irma, is now a Category 5 storm, and is heading towards the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. Although it's not yet known whether Irma will make landfall in the continental US, officials in the Florida Keys are already issuing evacuation recommendations and closing schools. The storm comes on the heels of Hurricane Harvey, which devastated parts of Texas, including Houston. Irma is already the fourth hurricane of 2017. The peak of the season is around September 10, which means more hurricanes are likely. On Tuesday, a tropical storm named Jose formed in the Atlantic east of Irma, though it's too early to say where it will go. The prevalence and severity of storms so far this year caught many people by surprise, however, and has left many others scrambling to prepare. If you're wondering what to do in the face of hurricane threats, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have resources to help people get ready. Here are some of their recommendations. Miguel Juarez, right, offers free water to passing vehicles Sunday, Aug. 27, 2017, in Rockport, Texas. Since grocery stores empty out and prices get gouged in an emergency situation, stocking up ahead of time is best. Here are FEMA's full e mergency supply list guidelines. Louis Naro waits with his family for a visit from Vice President Mike Pence, Thursday, Aug. 31, 2017, in Rockport, Texas, an area that received heavy damage from Hurricane Harvey. This plan should include packing your emergency supply kit and go-bag. Additionally, you should pick an out-of-state contact that everyone will get in touch with in the event that your family gets separated. Each person should carry a sheet in their wallet with that person's contact information, as well as other important numbers and information. In an ideal scenario, families should practice these plans ahead of time to work out any kinks and gain comfort with them before encountering stressful conditions. To keep track of a developing storm, you can also sign up for alerts from the National Weather Service (NWS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Residents wait at a high school gym before they are evacuated as the outer bands of Hurricane Harvey begin to make landfall, Friday, Aug. 25, 2017, in Corpus Christi, Texas. If you live in an area that could face such a threat, make an evacuation plan with your family that includes which roads you'll take and where you'll go. Generally, emergency shelters are set up in the days ahead of a storm, so you can consult FEMA or your local city government to determine where those will be. However, some cities have good reason to avoid issuing evacuation orders. When Harvey hit Houston, officials didn't tell residents to leave in order to avoid clogging highways and other roads. Those drivers could have found themselves getting into accidents or stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic as waters overtook roadways. When Hurricane Rita barreled toward Texas in 2005, an exodus of about 3 million people contributed to at least 73 deaths before the storm arrived. So if there's no voluntary or mandatory evacuation in place for your area, stay put and keep your car in good working condition with a full gas tank in case a late evacuation order does come. Once a mandatory evacuation is put in place, however, you should leave immediately. That's why it's important to have a go-bag prepared. Wires are exposed after a traffic signal was snapped by the winds of Hurricane Harvey in downtown Corpus Christi, Texas, Saturday, Aug. 26, 2017. Because lighting candles can create a fire risk, flashlights with extra batteries are key. The DHS also recommends that you keep your cell phone fully charged as long as you have electricity. If you're anticipating that power might go out, it's also a good idea to turn your freezer and refrigerator to their coldest settings about 6 hours before a storm hits. That way, food will last longer if the power goes out. You can also move things to the freezer if you won't need them right away. If your house loses power, avoid opening the fridge and freezer doors as much as possible to keep cold air in. Freezing ice packs and preparing coolers to store food can help keep things fresh for longer. It is possible, of course, to buy a portable generator or get one installed if you're planning far ahead. But any generator should be protected from moisture and kept outside, well away from any windows or doors. Because there is also a chance water will be cut off after power has gone out, FEMA recommends filing sinks and bathtubs in order to have extra water to use for flushing toilets or washing. Homes are surrounded by floodwaters from Tropical Storm Harvey Tuesday, Aug. 29, 2017, in Spring, Texas. The simplest is to secure rain gutters to the house and clear clogged areas or drains to prevent water from building up and causing damage. You can also stockpile sand bags, plastic sheeting, and plywood to be used as necessary. If you have time, it's a good idea to unplug appliances, and move any light furniture and valuables to higher floors of your house or building. More costly preparations include installing sump pumps with backup batteries and a water alarm to alert you when the system is getting overloaded. It's also a good idea to waterproof your basement if you live in a flood-prone area, and to elevate your heating system, water heater, and electric panel to heights at which flood waters won't cause damage. The most important (though often most difficult) precaution to take is avoiding walking or driving through flood waters. Even 6 inches of fast-moving water can knock a person down, and 12 inches can sweep away a car. The water can also hide dangerous debris and make it hard to tell where the ground has washed away. Plus, there's a risk of electricity from downed power lines, contamination from sewage and other chemicals, and wildlife like snakes and fire ants trying to escape. A tree is seen knocked sideways during the passing of Hurricane Harvey on August 26, 2017 in Corpus Christi, Texas. Irma is currently a Category 5 storm, which means its wind speeds are at least 157 mph. But there's no category above 5, which makes it hard to differentiate between the most severe hurricanes. When heavy winds arrive, stay away from windows, since fast-moving debris could break the glass and fly into the house. FEMA recommends seeking shelter on the home's lowest level, in an interior room, though a flood risk could change that calculation. If you're bracing for extreme winds, you should also reinforce doors, windows, walls, and roofs as much as possible in advance. Putting tape on windows does not help, however, since it could cause the glass to break into larger, deadlier shards. The DHS recommends bringing any outdoor objects (like patio tables and chairs) inside, and anchoring anything that shouldn't be indoors (like propane tanks). If you have more time to prepare your house, the DHS recommends trimming and removing damaged trees and limbs to minimize the risk of them falling and causing damage or injuries. It may also be a worthwhile long-term investment to retrofit and secure your roof, windows, and doors, or to add storm shutters. A volunteer helps clean up the damage from a Lutheran church in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Harvey in Dickinson, Texas, U.S., September 2, 2017. FEMA suggests waiting for officials to say an area is safe before returning. The agency also recommends avoiding the use of electrical equipment, waiting for a given building to be inspected before entering it, and drinking bottled or boiled water until tap water is declared safe. All food that was exposed to flood water (even if it's in a can or bottle) should be thrown out, as should anything perishable that was not kept at the proper temperature. As far as insurance is concerned, it's best to take as many photos as possible of the initial damage, and to do what you can to prevent further damage (covering ceiling holes with tarps, for example) since insurance plans might not cover the losses sustained after a storm.

Some three million people on the U.S. southeast coast faced an urgent evacuation order Thursday as Hurricane Matthew bore down on Florida. Matthew hit them as a Category Four hurricane but has since been downgraded to three, on a scale of five, by the US National Hurricane Center. The first evacuations were ordered in the United States as coastal residents prepared to escape the approaching monster storm, expected off the East Coast later this week. The dangerous Category 4 storm blew ashore around dawn in Haiti. It unloaded heavy rain as it swirled on toward a lightly populated part of Cuba and the Bahamas. Hurricane Matthew roared into the southwestern coast of the island of Hispaniola with devastating storm conditions as it headed north toward Cuba and the eastern coast of Florida. As the Category 4 hurricane creeps closer, Cuba, in the likely path of destruction, ordered the evacuation of more than 250,000 people from the east of the island. Hurricane Matthew took aim at densely populated Haiti and Jamaica on Monday, packing winds that could sweep away flimsy buildings and bringing torrential rain that could trigger deadly landslides and floods.

Tampa dodged Irma's worst, but the city is still at risk and unprepared for major hurricanes Tamara Lush , Associated Press Sep. 13, 2017, 8:37 AM ST. createPerformanceMark('first image displayed'); A man walks past a fallen tree along Bayshore Blvd in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma in Tampa, Florida on September 11, 2017. There was good reason to worry. Since 1921, when about 120,000 people lived there, the region has added 3 million residents and tens of thousands of new homes along low-lying waterfront property. The storm left Tampa and St. Petersburg with only power outages and downed tree limbs to contend with. Study after study has shown the Tampa region is among the world's most vulnerable when it comes to major storms. Yet so far it has failed to take some key precautions, such as burying power lines, ending the practice of filling and building in wetlands and putting brakes on residential development. Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn told an AP reporter Sunday morning that he expected his Davis Islands home to flood and was bracing for 5 to 8 feet of storm surge. By Monday, his tone was giddily cheerful, after his city and home weren't destroyed as predicted. We can't go another 90 years without a direct hit. We came close last night.

The British Overseas Territories, principally the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, and Turks and Caicos Islands, have yet to recover from hurricanes Irma and Maria of 2017, and the Foreign Office is concerned that more hurricanes, even on a lesser scale compared with those of 2017, could have a devastating effect on already damaged infrastructure. The aim was to achieve clearer command and control structures, and a way to escalate a response quickly once a crisis appeared imminent.

Category 5 Hurricane Maria is seen traveling across the Atlantic Ocean toward Puerto Rico on Sept. 18, 2017, in satellite imagery provided by the National Hurricane Center. The hurricane center statement said Maria was centered about 35 miles east-southeast of Dominica and 55 miles northeast of Martinique. The mammoth storm was moving west-northwest at 9 mph. For the first time in 85 years, Puerto Rico is expected to suffer a direct landfall from such a strong hurricane. In Antigua, another island battered by Irma, yacht skipper Kevin Joseph took extra precautions ahead of Maria. Now those evacuees and native Puerto Ricans are bracing for another catastrophic hurricane. Puerto Rico housing authorities said there are 450 shelters able to take in 62,714 evacuees, and up to 125,428 in an emergency situation. But there are six fewer shelters available post-Irma, since some schools still have no electricity. What to expect from Maria The storm will affect parts of the Leeward Islands and the British and US Virgin Islands for next couple of days, the center said. Other Leeward Islands are now under hurricane warnings, including Guadeloupe, Dominica, St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat. The US Virgin Islands and the British Virgin Islands are under warnings. Trump issued an emergency declaration for the US Virgin Islands. There are tropical storm warnings in effect for Antigua and Barbuda, Saba and St. Eustatius, St. Martin, Anguilla and St. Lucia. The government of the Dominican Republic has issued a hurricane watch from Isla Saona to Puerto Plata, and a tropical storm watch west of Puerto Plata to the northern Dominican Republic-Haiti border. The British Foreign Office said more than 1,300 troops are in the region, on affected islands or nearby locations, ready to help after Maria goes by. One military team has been deployed to the British Virgin Islands. A British military reconaissance team is on standby to go to Montserrat and assess needs, the office said. Hurricane Jose Another hurricane, Jose, is also churning in the Atlantic and has spawned tropical storm warnings for part of the US East Coast. At 5 p.m. Monday, Hurricane Jose was about 250 miles east-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and was moving north at 10 mph. The tropical storm warning is in effect for parts of southern New England, from Watch Hill, Rhode Island, to Hull, Massachusetts, the NHC said. Jose is expected to weaken in the next few days, but will likely remain a hurricane through Tuesday. Trademark and Copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.

Hurricane and tropical advisories were dropped for the U.S. and British Virgin Islands as well as Antigua. While hurricane warnings remained in effect for Sint Maarten, St. Martin, and St. Barthelemy, it seemed these islands would just get brushed by the storm rather than a direct hit. (National Hurricane Center) The storm is forecast to meander over the Atlantic Ocean for the next few days and will need to be watched later next week as some models suggest it could make a move toward the eastern U.S., although that is a low likelihood scenario. 11 p.m. update Friday: Hurricane Katia made landfall north of Tecolutla, Mexico according to the National Hurricane Center's 11 p.m update Friday. The storm had weakened substantially prior to landfall, with peak winds of 75 mph down from 105 mph earlier Friday. Hurricane watches were upgraded to warnings for Antigua, Barbuda, Aguilla, St. Martin and St. Barthelemy. The center of this extremely dangerous storm could pass very close to these islands on Saturday. Original post, updated Friday morning Hurricane Irma is not the only show in town. Jose, following a similar path to Irma in the eastern Atlantic, has grown into an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane with 150 mph winds. On Saturday, it could strike or at least brush some of the same islands in the northern Lesser Antilles decimated by Irma Tuesday night and Wednesday. Taking Irma and Jose together, this is the first time on record two storms in the tropical Atlantic Ocean have attained 150 mph winds at the same time. It is expected to make landfall along Mexico's Gulf Coast Friday night. This is the first time on record three straight storms have attained Category 4 or higher status, according to Klotzbach. The exact track of Jose is still somewhat in question, and there is a chance it could escape to the east of the already battered islands. But it's too close to call. After the storm passes the northern Leeward Islands, it will no longer be a threat to land areas, curling away from the United States. This system formed in the western Gulf of Mexico from a lingering disturbance earlier this week. The storm is forecast to track westward toward Mexico and make landfall Friday night or Saturday morning. (National Hurricane Center) A hurricane warning is out from Cabo Rojo to Laguna Verde. While a 5- to 7-foot storm surge and damaging winds are likely close to where this hurricane makes landfall, torrential rains will affect a much larger area. Three hurricanes at the same time is highly unusual Incredibly, all three of the active hurricanes in the Atlantic basin could affect land at the same time on Saturday: Irma over the Bahamas (and approaching Florida), Jose over the northeastern Leewards, and Katia in Mexico. It is quite rare to have three simultaneous hurricanes. The last time this occurred was in 2010 with Hurricanes Igor, Julia and Karl. In an unlikely coincidence, these storms are almost in the same order and position as Irma, Jose and Katia, and have the same first three letters (I, J, K).

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next Hurricane Irma battered parts of Cuba and the central Bahamas, and forecasters predicted Friday evening the massive storm will strengthen into a Category 5 storm again before it slams into the Florida Keys. Irma, which has sustained winds of 155 mph, has left a trail of devastation and death in much of the Caribbean as it advanced toward South Florida. Forecasters with the National Hurricane Center say the storm will be begin to turn north on Saturday as it passes Cuba then head toward the Keys and cities on Florida's Gulf Coast. Irma is expected to have sustained winds of 160 mph by the time it makes landfall in the Florida Keys on Sunday. There were worries the storm's most powerful winds, on the northeastern side of the core, could pummel Miami, but it appears the city will avoid a direct hit, while still getting pounded by strong winds and heavy rains. At least 24 people were killed this week when Irma pummeled northern Caribbean islands such as Barbuda and the Virgin Islands. Irma slammed the Turks and Caicos and southeastern Bahamas early Friday before its center headed between northern Cuba and central Bahamas. Hurricane Irma: Live updates Irma is expected be near the Florida Keys and South Florida by early Sunday, and many residents there are moving inland or to shelters. Some counties are under evacuation orders. Staying in homes could subject residents to storm surge as high as 12 feet, the governor added. Forecasters have advised that the storm's potential path could change as it passes Cuba then turns north toward Florida and that most of Florida will feel the storm's impact. At its peak, a then-Category 5 Irma sustained maximum wind speeds of at least 185 mph for longer (37 hours) than any storm on record. The Red Cross estimates 1.2 million people have already been battered by the storm. Tracking Hurricane Irma's path Here are the latest developments -- Around 5 p.m. ET, Irma's center was about 195 miles east of Caibarien, Cuba, moving west with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph. Hurricane-force winds could be felt as far as 70 miles from the center. A day-by-day look at Hurricane Irma's path ahead -- Irma's bands whipped the Turks and Caicos and the southeastern Bahamas on Thursday night and Friday morning, and is forecast to move between the north coast of Cuba and the central Bahamas through Saturday. -- Conditions on the northern coast of Cuba deteriorated rapidly Friday evening, CNN's Patrick Oppmann reported from Caibarien. As rain flew sideways, visibility plummeted and it was impossible to travel. Oppmann reported many Cubans were staying in the homes, protecting their belongings. The anatomy of a hurricane -- Irma led to at least 24 deaths in the Caribbean, including nine in unspecified French territories, one on Barbuda, one at the British overseas territory of Anguilla, two in Dutch-administered St. Maarten, four in the British Virgin Islands, four on the US Virgin Islands, and three in Puerto Rico. Officials didn't specify which French Caribbean territories had nine deaths but earlier indicated some had been on the island of St. Martin. -- The three deaths in Puerto Rico were at least loosely linked to Irma. One person died from a fall while being taken to a shelter; another was killed in a car crash; a third died of electrocution, the governor said. -- Hurricane warnings are in effect for parts of central Cuba, and the southeastern, central and northwestern Bahamas. Hurricane warnings also are in effect from Sebastian Inlet on the east coast, southward around the Florida Peninsula to Anna Maria Island on the panhandle. The warning includes the Florida Keys, Lake Okeechobee and Florida Bay. -- The Red Cross said as many as 26 million people could be exposed to destructive winds and torrential rain just in the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba. -- Both the French and Dutch portions of the island of St. Martin are suffering looting in the wake of Irma, authorities said. Hurricane Irma victims need your help -- Irma could overwhelm parts of the Bahamas, a nation of about 390,000, with storm surges of up to 20 feet -- well above the islands' elevation, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. US and European forecast models predict the eye could strike the Keys and then the Everglades, west of Miami, on Saturday night into Sunday morning. 'Ahead of the game': Florida seniors, nursing homes prep for Hurricane Irma Though the core has the most power, Irma is huge; winds of at least tropical-storm force cover 70,000 square miles -- larger than the area of Florida (65,000 square miles). At some point late Saturday into Tuesday, the entire state could see at least hurricane-force gusts of 74 mph and above, CNN's Myers said. In Miami-Dade County alone, about 660,000 of its 2.6 million population have been asked to evacuate, Mayor Carlos Gimenez said. Farther north, on Daytona Beach, Michael Hanna was itching to leave Friday morning but first had to board up his beach apparel store. Disney, other Florida theme parks closing as Irma nears Irma could cause power outages for weeks in parts of South Florida, and more than 4.1 million customers -- or 9 million people -- could be affected by outages at some point, Florida Power and Light Co. said. Evacuees stocked up on supplies, waited for hours at gas stations and sat through massive traffic jams. People also flocked to South Florida airports, but schedules were in flux. Florida is not the only state preparing for possible impact. Long, the FEMA administrator, said people from Alabama to North Carolina should watch the storm. Georgia's Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for 30 counties and has ordered evacuations for coastal areas east of Interstate 95, including Savannah, starting Saturday. The governors of North and South Carolina also declared states of emergency. Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate closes ahead of Hurricane Irma Devastation to islands Irma brought heavy rain and powerful winds Thursday night and Friday morning to the low-lying Turks and Caicos Islands. Residents of the islands, a British overseas territory with about 35,000 people, were told to stay put. Desmond Piccolo Henry took shelter in his concrete home with his wife and a friend on one of the islands, Providenciales, as the storm rocked the area early Friday. Video he posted to Facebook showed downed tree limbs and other destruction. In Puerto Rico, about 56,680 customers were without water, with the island's northeast hit the hardest, according to Jesus Poupart of the emergency operations center. After Irma, Hurricane Jose looms The Caribbean islands already pummeled by Irma have begun assessing the damage, finding shredded buildings, battered cars and streets submerged in water. Irma's eye passed directly over Barbuda on Wednesday, and now the northeastern Caribbean nation is anxiously watching Hurricane Jose to the east, which has strengthened to a Category 4 storm. Anguilla, Barbuda, St. Martin and St. Barts are under a hurricane warning for Jose, which could pass close to those islands Saturday. The government called for voluntary evacuations from Barbuda, Browne said. Irma also badly hit St. Martin with about 50 people reported injured. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte described the looting situation in St. Maarten, the Dutch portion of the island, as serious, a spokesman for his office said Friday. The government said emergency flights delivering water and other supplies to the island will be used to take residents and visitors off it. Hurricane season hasn't peaked yet.

The National Hurricane Center on Thursday issued a hurricane watch for the southernmost part of Florida, the first such alert Irma has prompted in the continental United States. A storm surge watch, which warned of potentially life-threatening levels of water, was also issued for the southern part of the state, an area that includes the Florida Keys, which a day earlier had begun evacuations. With potentially millions of people hitting the road to escape, Scott said emergency efforts were underway to keep fuel shipments moving to gas stations. Increasing evacuations were getting underway across South Florida. On Thursday, Broward County began to evacuate people from the area along the Atlantic. Miami-Dade County, which had announced evacuations on Wednesday, expanded the order on Thursday to include more people across the coastal portion of the county. In Naples, Fla., a Best Buy opened on Thursday morning to about two dozen shoppers waiting outside. Mike Ducheneau, the manager, said that the store had gotten about 20 or 30 cellphone chargers delivered the previous night. The shoppers waiting in line flooded to the cellphone section, snatching up the chargers that remained. Haiti raised its hurricane alert level to red, its highest, and the north coast remained under a hurricane watch as the central coast faced the threat of tropical storm winds and rain. Nevertheless, aid groups said the national hurricane response appeared to be slow. Many evacuations in the north were set to unfold as rains rapidly approached and low-quality shelters were still being finished. School was canceled across the country as national warnings went out through social media, radio and television. In some remote towns, word to take shelter was being spread largely via local officials with bullhorns. One major concern was the spread of a cholera outbreak already plaguing Haiti.

More than 5,500 people in the country were evacuated in the run-up to the storm, officials said. On the islands of Barbuda and Anguilla, meanwhile, at least one death was reported on each. The death toll fluctuated Thursday as officials released, then revised, the number of fatalities. And with places in the Caribbean taking direct hits from Irma, the toll was expected to rise when officials are able to communicate with people on the devastated islands. The National Hurricane Center in Miami was remarkably calm and hushed on Thursday, considering the storm that is fast approaching. The center on the campus of Florida International University, a location that puts it much further from the coast than the old headquarters in Coral Gables, which was badly damaged during Hurricane Andrew a quarter-century ago. The forecasters here are giving regular updates on Hurricane Irma and taking turns giving TV interviews. The place will get busier in the next few days, and on Saturday night will go into lockdown, with metal shutters enclosing the doors and everyone in for the night until the storm passes. That storm, along with the recent devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey in Texas, has lingered in the background of the urgent warnings issued by Florida officials. States of emergency were also declared in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. On Thursday, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R) expanded his declaration from six coastal counties to 30 total counties, issuing a mandatory evacuation for some areas. Officials across Florida responded to the alarming forecasts by slowly shutting down the contours of daily life. Schools closed across the state, including the University of Central Florida in Orlando, which could face punishing weather if Irma crawls up the coastline. The University of Florida, located inland in Gainesville, announced that it was canceling a football game scheduled for Saturday and would then close its campus on Sunday and Monday. The National Hurricane Center said little overall motion on the storm was expected though late Thursday. Berman reported from Washington.

SUBSCRIBE Hurricane Irma continued its deadly and destructive path through the Caribbean on Friday morning, and is still on track to slam into Miami this weekend. The storm, which went from a Category 5 to a 4, remained powerful, with winds of 150 mph, according to an 11 a.m. ET National Hurricane Center bulletin. Irma was about 405 miles southeast of Miami, with potential landfall in Florida appearing more likely for Sunday morning. A swath of South Florida remained under mandatory evacuations, including coastal communities in Miami and Palm Beach. In addition, Gov. Rick Scott said Friday morning that evacuation is mandatory for those living in cities south of Lake Okeechobee, the largest freshwater lake in the state. With long lines at gas stations and highways clogged, emergency officials advised people not to travel far, but locate local shelters that are safely away from storm surges. Ahead of Irma, Miami Beach was virtually deserted Friday morning, Mayor Philip Levine told TODAY. He said the city used buses and trolleys to help move people, including senior and homeless populations. Hurricane warnings were issued Thursday night from Jupiter Inlet south around the Florida peninsula to Bonita Beach, as well as for the Florida Keys, Lake Okeechobee and Florida Bay. Storm surges in those areas could be anywhere from 3 feet to 6 feet or higher, according to the hurricane center. PHOTOS: Hurricane Irma Carves Path of Destruction in Caribbean The hurricane center said Thursday that a slight westward shift in Irma's projected path indicated that it could make landfall just east of Key Largo, bringing its eye wall, which carries the most destructive winds, over Miami with major hurricane winds. Hurricane conditions were expected in portions of southern Florida and the Florida Keys on Saturday night or early Sunday. Tropical storm winds are likely to arrive in the FL Keys and south FL Saturday. Preparations should be rushed to completion. But even a slightly weaker Irma could do serious damage to Miami and lash the low-lying city with 129-mph winds and gusts of up to 159 mph. Hurricane-force winds extended 70 miles from the center, so even if Irma somehow doesn't make direct landfall on Florida at all, its very large wind field promises dangerous surf and coastal flooding throughout the Southeast coast well away from the center into early next week, forecasters said. It nearly wiped the city of Homestead off the map. The governors of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina have all declared states of emergency. On its way to Florida, Irma passed the Turks & Caicos Islands, a low-lying British territory, and parts of the Bahamas. It hit Puerto Rico with a glancing blow late Wednesday, killing at least three people, after battering the islands of Barbuda, St. Bart and St. Martin. Thousands of people were left homeless in French-controlled St. Martin, where four people were reported dead and Irma demolished 95 percent of buildings on the island. One death was reported on the Dutch side of the island. Another death was reported on the island of Barbuda. Video obtained by NASA had the eye of Irma, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane on record, passing just to the north of the Dominican Republic on Thursday morning. NBC News Florida Power & Light, the nation's third-largest electric utility, warned that damage to the state's energy grid could be devastating. Silagy said FPL, which has mutual-assistance agreements with utilities in other states, was positioning 11,000 employees and contractors in areas that are expected to be hardest hit. The state was also working to get more fuel to drivers as many areas began running low on gas. As far north as Gainesville, near the Georgia border, 44 percent of stations had run dry, it said.

But, while extremely costly, it may not rank among the state's worst-ever hurricane disasters, as had been feared. Leading up to its back-to-back landfalls in the Florida Keys and on Marco Island, several twists of fortune eased the pain the storm inflicted on the state. And only slight deviations would have made the storm's outcome much more severe. The first stroke of good luck for Florida occurred when the center of a Category 5 Irma scraped along Cuba's north coast. This, of course, turned into Cuba's misfortune. But Irma's interaction with land weakened the storm from a potentially catastrophic Category 5 to a Category 3. Can see Irma's interaction with Cuba has mostly consisted of bouncing around near the shore. Visual changes but powerhouse circulation. Key West then caught the next lucky break.

Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Service , Privacy Policy and Cookies Policy . 11, 2017, 12:20 PM createPerformanceMark('first image displayed'); This Sept. 6, 2017 photo provided by the Dutch Defense Ministry shows a view of St. Maarten in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. The latter, currently moving across Florida, is the strongest sustained hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane strength is measured on the Saffir-Simpson scale, ranging from one (the lowest) to five (the highest) based on the hurricane's wind speed and estimated potential damage. This takes into account parameters such as whether the hurricane uproots trees or removes roofs from houses, and whether the destruction could last for days or months. Initially, Hurricane Irma was rated as a category five (it is now losing energy), with winds moving at 175 mph - destroying homes and causing power failure in the Caribbean. Climate change People have been quick to ask if Hurricane Irma is connected to climate change and whether this is a sign of things to come. It remains uncertain whether hurricanes have significantly increased in frequency or severity as global temperatures have risen, partly due to a lack of long-term data. We know that hurricane formation is affected by changes in sea surface temperatures - a warm ocean helps fuel hurricanes. This is partly driven by natural periodic and cyclic variations in the Earth's climatic and oceanic systems, meaning that in some years the ocean is warmer than in others. Studies have presented mixed views of what will happen in the future with global warming. However, there are many consistent models and research articles indicating that there will be fewer hurricanes along the Atlantic coast, but that those that do form will be more severe- due to the warmer temperatures. However, it's important to keep in mind that what we've seen recently, compared with decades ago, is not so much a change in hurricanes, but a change in impacts. Many coasts have become increasingly urbanized, and this trend is likely to continue. As with many small islands, much of the population of Barbuda, Guadeloupe and others in the Caribbean are situated on the narrow coastal fringe - meaning they experience the full force of natural disasters, sometimes on scales never seen before. This means there is more infrastructure to be destroyed or damaged during extreme weather conditions than say to 100 years ago. The same can be said as Irma moves over Florida. Waves crash against the Havana seafront boulevard El Malecon ahead of Hurricane Irma. Thomson Reuters Vulnerable economies Infrastructure on islands, such as harbors and airports, are key lifelines to the outside world - and any disruption to these can have serious consequences, potentially for many years. On small islands, infrastructure is partly there to support the economy (including tourism), which in turn provides further economic development, social welfare and health benefits to the wider population. Take the infrastructure away as Irma has, and the economy declines leading to a shock. This is because, historically, small islands have been essential maritime or colonial hubs or trading posts. But today they are highly reliant on external trade, often through fisheries, agriculture or tourism. Concentrating on one or two industries makes islands strong, but when extreme events or global disasters occur, the shock means they count the cost. Essentially, they have their eggs all in one basket. Hurricane Andrew, also a category five event, made landfall in August 1992 - affecting the Bahamas and Florida. Luckily, advertising campaigns and repairs ultimately prevented the loss in tourist revenue. This is an important lesson about how to respond to such events. Other extreme events have caused long-lived adverse effects. For instance, in the Maldives in the Indian Ocean, the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami affected tourism and wider development for several years. Clearly there is a need for planning in emergency response. This needs to be targeted and accompanied by long-term resilience strategies. Shocks can also provide opportunities. Thanks to the Maldivian Safer Islands programme, islands have been constructed to a higher elevation to reduce the long-term risk of flooding. Irma has reminded the world that extra help is needed when an island state is partially destroyed. Storm damage after Hurricane Irma is shown in Tortola, part of the British Virgin Islands, on Sept. 7, 2017. In addition to warming temperatures and potential increase in future severity, the slow, but long-term effects of sea-level rise could also increase the extent of flood impacts during and after extreme events. From 1901 to 2010, sea levels rose by about 1.9 millimeters a year. This is projected to accelerate, so that sea-levels are about a metre higher in 2100 than today. Over a century, sea-level rise could make the difference between minor and major flooding, and the longevity of impacts. Indeed, long-lasting impacts may provide impetus for introducing a category six of the Saffir-Simpson scale. This could describe cases that have a permanent effect on living conditions - potentially making some areas permanently uninhabitable. Such effects are currently not accounted for on the scale. Whether we do introduce a new category remains to be seen, but it is certainly something worth discussing. Adaptation to climate change and extreme events can help to increase resilience and reduce damage in extreme conditions. But due to their shear strength, events such as Hurricane Irma cannot be adapted to. Sadly, humans will never be totally resilient to extreme events and long-lasting impacts remains a major challenge for all. All rights reserved.

The Miami and Fort Lauderdale airports shut down, and those in Orlando and Tampa planned to do the same later in the day. With winds that peaked at 185 mph (300 kph), Irma was once the most powerful hurricane ever recorded in the open Atlantic. Given its mammoth size and strength and its projected course, it could still prove one of the most devastating hurricanes ever to hit Florida and inflict damage on a scale not seen here in 25 years.

ST. Irma regained Category 5 status late Friday, and with its 160 mph (260 kph) winds battering Cuba and taking aim at the Miami metropolitan area of 6 million people, the death toll in the storm's wake across the Caribbean climbed to 22. Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and the eastern part of Cuba reported no major casualties or damage by mid-afternoon after Irma rolled north of the Caribbean's biggest islands.

But many residents and tourists farther east were left reeling after the storm ravaged some of the world's most exclusive tropical playgrounds, known for their turquoise waters and lush green vegetation. Among them: St. Martin, St. Barts, St. Thomas, Barbuda and Anguilla. Irma smashed homes, shops, roads and schools; knocked out power, water and telephone service; trapped thousands of tourists; and stripped trees of their leaves, leaving an eerie, blasted-looking landscape littered with sheet metal and splintered lumber. On Friday, looting and gunshots were reported on St. Martin, and a curfew was imposed in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Many of Irma's victims fled their islands on ferries and fishing boats for fear of Hurricane Jose, a Category 4 storm with 150 mph winds that could punish some places all over again this weekend. Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later. On Barbuda, a coral island rising a mere 125 feet (38 meters) above sea level, authorities ordered an evacuation of all 1,400 people to neighboring Antigua, where Stevet Jeremiah was reunited with one son and made plans to bury another. Jeremiah, who sells lobster and crab to tourists, was huddled in her wooden home on Barbuda early Wednesday with her partner and their 2- and 4-year-old boys as Irma ripped open their metal roof and sent the ocean surging into the house. Her younger son, Carl Junior Francis, was swept away. Neighbors found his body after sunrise. He just turned 2, the 17th, last month. Her first task, she said, would be to organize his funeral. The dead included 11 on St. Martin and St. Barts, four in the U.S. Virgin Islands, four in the British Virgin Islands and one each on Anguilla and Barbuda. Also, a 16-year-old junior professional surfer drowned Tuesday in Barbados while surfing large swells generated by an approaching Irma. Many victims picked through the rubble of what had once been Caribbean dream getaway homes. On St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, power lines and towers were toppled, a water and sewage treatment plant was heavily damaged, and the harbor was in ruins, along with hundreds of homes and dozens of businesses. Opera singer Laura Strickling and her husband, Taylor, moved to St. Thomas three years ago from Washington so he could take a job as a lawyer. They rented a top-floor apartment with a stunning view of the turquoise water of Megan's Bay, which is surrounded by low hills covered by trees. Strickling huddled with her husband and their year-old daughter in a basement apartment along with another family as the storm raged for 12 hours. It was so loud we thought the roof was gone. Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later. When they emerged, they found their apartment was unscathed and the trees had no leaves. Irma threatened to push its way northward from one end of Florida to the other beginning Sunday morning in what many fear could be the long-dreaded, catastrophic Big One. Across Florida and Georgia, more than 6 million people were warned to leave their homes, clogging interstates as far away as Atlanta. At the same time, more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) to the east, authorities commandeered a ferry from Montserrat with room for 350 and began moving people from Barbuda to the larger island of Antigua. The owners of several fishing boats also volunteered to help. On St. Martin, which is divided between Dutch and French control, cafes and shops were swamped, and the storm left gnarled black branches denuded of leaves. Battered cars, corrugated metal, plywood, wrought iron and other debris covered street after street. Roofs were torn off numerous houses. There was little left of St. Martin's Hotel Mercure but its sign, painted on a still-standing wall. The cleanup was already underway for some. One man chopped at the branches of a bare tree. Another heaved what appeared to be furniture stuffing onto a pile. People sat in chairs outside a hospital, waiting to be seen. William Marlin, prime minister of the Dutch side of St. Martin, said recovery was expected to take months even before Jose threatened to make things worse. On St. Thomas, Jodi Jabas and Matt Biwer were combing through the wreckage of the home they had been busy remodeling before the storm. They huddled in a studio apartment on the ground floor as Irma roared overhead. The storm took off the roof and a good section of the house with it. Jalon Shortte said riding out Irma in his top-floor apartment on Tortola, in the British Virgin Islands, was the scariest thing he has ever been through. The air pressure hurt his ears, trees fell on his roof, windows blew out and a door came off, he wrote on Facebook. The storm even took paint off the walls, he said. His Facebook page was filled with images he took from around Tortola of sunken yachts, crushed vehicles and mounds of debris. He said looting was rampant. Amid the devastation, Shortte worked to bring a water desalination plant online.

Even areas that didn't face a direct hit from Irma saw flooding and downed power lines. In Riviera Beach, on Florida's east coast, winds partially ripped roofs off two apartment buildings, forcing rescuers to evacuate about 50 people from the complex, the city's mayor said.

Gov. Rick Scott (R) sounded dire warnings about the storm, urging residents in evacuation zones to leave their homes immediately. But before the storm reaches the peninsula, the Florida Keys will experience its full force. But the storm is expected to strengthen as it moves away from Cuba and toward the Florida Keys, near where its core is forecast Sunday morning. Regardless of its track, all of Florida will likely experience damaging winds, rains, flooding and possibly tornadoes. The National Weather Service said southwestern Florida could see storm surges up to 15 feet if peak surge happens during high tide. A storm surge warning is in effect for much of the Florida peninsula. At least 50,000 people are staying in 260 state shelters, Scott said. He implored nurses to volunteer throughout Florida; the state desperately needs 1,000 nurses in its special needs shelters.

At least six ambulances have responded to people who were overcome in the muggy, 90-degree heat. Troopers, the National Guard and local police sought out people in wheelchairs and moved them to the front of the line, said Lt. Greg Bueno, public information officer for the Florida Highway Patrol. Leaning on a cane, Betty Sellers, 68, and her son, Doug, 49, got in line at 9:30 a.m. and were still 100 people away from the front doors. Officials at the Collier County emergency operations center in Naples said 15,000 people have filled its shelters, but they are trying to expand space in each location to accommodate more people. The county said it will be difficult for it to house everyone who needs or wants to evacuate in shelters and urged people who can find shelter with friends or family to go there. Lee County manager Roger Desjarlais said Saturday afternoon that the county is sheltering 22,000 people. The two counties combined have a population of about 1 million. Officials are also concerned that wind gusts will send water over the Herbert Hoover Dike that holds back Lake Okeechobee, which covers more than 700 square miles. Evacuations have been ordered for cities and towns on the south side of the lake in Hendry, Palm Beach and Glades counties. Nearly 29,000 people have already lost power across the state as of Saturday afternoon. Florida Power and Light said 4.1 million people across the state could lose power as a result of the storm, and Scott said utility crews are standing by in Florida and surrounding states to get power back as soon as possible after the storm moves out. The storm has already heavily damaged some Caribbean islands, killing at least 22 people. In St. Martin, 25 United States citizens were evacuated on a C130 military aircraft Friday from Sonesta Great Bay Beach Resort. Resort officials said another evacuation is expected. But with the airport seriously damaged, there was no way out. About 5.6 million people in Florida and 540,000 in Georgia have been ordered to evacuate. More than 44,000 people were ordered evacuated in South Carolina. In Pompano Beach on the southeast coast of Florida, winds were blowing to about 40 miles per hour Saturday afternoon. They ate a lunch of sausage pizza, canned corn, applesauce and milk or juice. Mayor Mark Fisher stopped by to thank people for evacuating to the shelter. It is one of 20 set up by Broward County. Another is specifically for people with special medical needs. Infants, parents and grandparents all crammed into an at-capacity emergency shelter at the Miami-Dade County Fair and Exposition. But some locals refused to budge. In Miami, some also stayed put. On Friday night, before Irma was expected to torpedo through the city, South Beach was deserted, shelters were overflowing and last-minute preparations were underway. Locals packed bars in Coconut Grove, drinking and watching the U.S. Open and the Miami Marlins game. There was a 45-minute wait for a table at Happy Wine. And people seemed to get the message. Bartender Edgar Escorche said he had opened at least 150 bottles of wine Friday evening. Parking was hard to find near the small restaurant. But before he clocks back in, he said he just wants to enjoy a bottle of wine with his wife.

The Turks and Caicos may also face significant impacts by the hurricane as it passes to their west. The slow-moving nature of the hurricane will translate to days rather than hours of pounding surf, high winds and heavy rain on the islands. More than 20 inches of rain can fall near and east of the center of the storm, especially over mountainous terrain. People are encouraged to make preparations now and heed evacuation orders as they are given. Great disruption to travel will also occur in the region. Cruise, freight and charter airline interests in the region should be prepared to change itineraries until the storm has passed. Commercial airline delays and cancellations are likely as the storm approaches. Many of these areas will be in need of assistance in the wake of the storm. Power may be out for days.

Hurricane Matthew, the most powerful Atlantic tropical storm in almost a decade, took aim for the Bahamas on Wednesday after it flooded streets, flattened homes and left a trail of destruction in Haiti. Matthew, a powerful storm with sustained winds of 140 mph, made landfall in Haiti just after 7 a.m. (8 a.m. ET) Tuesday. With communications down across much of the island, it remained too early to accurately assess the damage Wednesday morning, but civil defense officials said many homes had been destroyed or damaged in the south. Matthew brushed past the eastern tip of Cuba at about 8 p.m. ET, almost 53 years to the day after Hurricane Flora killed 2,000 Cubans on Oct. 3, 1963, the National Hurricane Center said. Landfall came at Juaco in a remote, sparsely populated part of the island, and preliminary reports indicated that the soaking rains and driving winds caused relatively little damage.

It was last updated to incorporate the 8 a.m. A hurricane catastrophe has become nearly unavoidable; it's only a matter of what areas are hardest hit and how severe the damage will be. Computer model information overnight Friday and early Saturday suggest Irma is most likely to track up Florida's west coast. Although small shifts in the track are still possible, the Florida Keys, Naples, Fort Myers and Tampa Bay area seem likely to be hit hard. Irrespective of the storm's exact track, damaging winds are likely to blast most if not all of the Florida peninsula. Saturday. The Hurricane Center had hoisted hurricane warnings for much of South and Central Florida on both coasts, reaching north of Tampa and Melbourne. Hurricane watches extended somewhat farther north. (National Hurricane Center) Landfall from the storm is most likely to occur sometime Sunday, when Irma's most destructive winds will move ashore, but tropical-storm-force winds are expected to progress up the Florida peninsula during the day Saturday. By early next week, Georgia, South Carolina and the interior Southeast could be in the storm's crosshairs In its 8 a.m. update, the Hurricane Center said the storm was positioned 225 miles south of Miami, chugging along to the west-northwest at 12 mph. As the eye of the storm moved over the north coast of Cuba early Saturday, its circulation was disrupted some by the land mass which caused the storm to weaken to a Category 4, with peak winds of 130 mph. On Friday night, it had briefly regained Category 5 intensity, packing 160 mph winds, just before making landfall on the Camaguey Archipelago of Cuba. It became the first Category 5 hurricane to make landfall in Cuba since 1924. Once Irma moves back over the water of the Florida straits, some of the warmest in the world (nearly 90 degrees), it is forecast to restrengthen some. It urged residents of Florida to rush preparations to completion. Meanwhile, Hurricane Katia made landfall along in Mexico's Gulf Coast Friday evening. And on Saturday, Hurricane Jose, which was nearly a Category 5, could hit some of the same small islands in the northern Lesser Antilles ravaged by Irma, including Antigua and Barbuda. Hurricane warnings were in effect. Caption Irma is wielding the most powerful winds ever recorded for a storm in the Atlantic Ocean. Thais Llorca Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Potential effects on Florida Several storm scenarios are possible in Florida, depending on the exact track Irma takes, but they are all disastrous due to Irma's size and strength. Hurricane-force winds expand 70 miles from the center, and tropical-storm-force winds expand 195 miles from the center. This implies that the entire peninsula, which is about 150 miles across, will be exposed to tropical-storm-force winds and most or all of it to hurricane-force winds. Tropical-storm-force winds are expected to reach South Florida between Saturday morning and early afternoon as Irma approaches from the south-southeast. (National Hurricane Center) Then, the all-important northward turn is still expected to take place early Sunday, when the storm would make landfall and unleash its worst effects. The most destructive winds and largest storm surge usually focus immediately to the northeast of where the center comes ashore. So exactly where the northward turn occurs is a critical question for Florida. As of Saturday morning, the most likely scenario based on computer-model guidance was that the storm will track along or just inland of Florida's west coast. Group of simulations from American (blue) and European (red) computer models from Friday night. Each color strand represents a different model simulation with slight tweaks to initial conditions. Note that the strands are clustered together where the forecast track is most confident but they diverge where the course of the storm is less certain. The bold red line is the average of all of the European model simulations, while the blue is the average of all the American model simulations.(StormVistaWxModels.com) Models, however, can shift. If it runs up the spine of the peninsula, the storm will be quicker to decay, but hurricane-force winds would reach both coasts. The European and American model forecasts run Friday morning show the storm making landfall near the southwest tip of Florida midday Sunday, and then coming up the spine of Florida. Model shifts are still possible. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles downed. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months. Note that such extreme winds are typically confined to the eye wall, which is only about 10 to 15 miles wide. That is why the exact track is important in terms of where the most severe wind damage concentrates. Due to the likelihood of widespread damaging winds, one model run by researchers at several universities projects that more than 2.5 million customers in Florida and the Southeastern United States will lose power. Wow, a large part of Naples could be inundated with water from storm surge. Over the Florida peninsula, 8 to 20 inches of rain is forecast, with the heaviest amounts most likely in the south. Flash flooding is likely to occur. 5-day rainfall forecast. (National Hurricane Center) Potential effects on Georgia and the Southeast Beyond Florida, there is the likelihood for damaging winds, flooding rain and a coastal storm surge farther north. Georgia is likely to see some of the worst effects Sunday night into Monday. Irrespective of Irma's track its circulation is enormous so it would still likely push a significant storm surge toward the Georgia and South Carolina coasts. Tropical-storm and even hurricane-force winds are also likely to affect much of Georgia and downed trees and power outages could be a big problem there. Strong winds could expand into southern South Carolina and eastern Alabama as Monday wears on. Heavy rains are also likely to swell north and west into Alabama, Tennessee, and western North Carolina Monday into Tuesday. Irma's path so far On Friday, before making landfall along Cuba's north central coast, Irma passed north of Haiti and then between Cuba's northeast coast and the Central Bahamas. Thursday evening, the center of the storm passed very close to the Turks and Caicos, producing potentially catastrophic Category 5 winds. The storm surge was of particular concern, as the water had the potential to rise 16 to 20 feet above normally dry land in coastal sections north of the storm center, causing extreme inundation. Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the hurricane passed directly over Barbuda and St. Martin in the northern Leeward Islands, the strongest hurricane ever recorded in that region and tied with the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane as the strongest Atlantic storm to strike land. As Barbuda took a direct hit, the weather station there clocked a wind gust to 155 mph before it went offline. The storm also passed directly over Anguilla and St. Martin early Wednesday, causing severe damage. Among the most intense storms on record, it trails only Hurricane Allen in 1980, which had winds of 190 mph. It is tied for second-most intense with Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane. The storm maintained maximum wind speeds of at least 180 mph for 37 hours, longer than any storm on Earth on record, passing Super Typhoon Haiyan, the previous record-holder (24 hours). Late Tuesday, its pressure dropped to 914 millibars (the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm), ranking as the lowest of any storm on record outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the Atlantic basin. Without a doubt, the World Meteorological Organization will retire the names Harvey and Irma after this season. Two Category 4 hurricanes hit in Texas and Louisiana six weeks apart that year.

Tampa should expect surges as large as 5ft (1.5 metres), he said, while south-eastern parts of the state would have surges high enough to float cars or submerge a person.

More than 3.3m homes and businesses in the state have lost power. Four hundred miles wide, Irma initially moved at 8mph, slower than forecast, and lost strength as it raked the peninsula. the hurricane made landfall on Marco Island as a category 3 storm, after hours of blasting south Florida with stinging, near horizontal rain, and sudden tornadoes. Early on Monday, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) downgraded Irma to category 1. As of 2am EDT, the storm was centred about 25 miles north-east of Tampa and moving north-north-west at almost 15 mph. The city has not been hit by a major storm since 1921, when its population was about 10,000. About 3 million people live in the greater Tampa area, which includes St Petersburg and Clearwater. On Sunday afternoon, large volumes of water were temporarily pushed out of Tampa Bay by winds, leaving an ominous plain behind. Irma leaves a trail of devastation in its wake, lashing islands in the Caribbean. Pressure on the prime minister, Theresa May, could build after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, tweeted that he would visit the French territory of St Martin on Tuesday. In St Petersburg, Florida, many refused to leave. With plywood extremely difficult to find and no gas available, many houses were not boarded up. Further south, Naples, a city of about 20,000 people in a wider metropolitan area of more than 300,000, the tide rose by 5.5ft, according to recordings taken by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Rubio warned residents not to become complacent after the winds seemed to die down. Florida Power and Light said more than 17,000 workers were positioned to move in once the most dangerous weather passed, but officials warned that some areas could be without power for weeks. Emergency services were suspended in Miami-Dade and Broward, with fire and police officials evaluating 911 calls on a case-by-case basis. In Broward, a county-wide curfew was in effect until 10am on Monday. Funnel clouds were spotted over Fort Lauderdale beach and a tornado touchdown was reported in Oakland Park, to the west of the city. Fire chief Joseph Zahralban said conditions were too dangerous to send crews to secure the cranes. Authorities repeated warnings to anyone not among the 7 million who had already evacuated. About 127,000 Floridians were in shelters. All 7,000 members of the Florida national guard were activated and 10,000 guardsmen from other states were on their way to help. President Donald Trump declared a major disaster in the state. In the Caribbean, Hurricane Jose, a category 4 storm, shifted north and away from land, giving hope to the survivors of Irma.

On a nearby beach, where calm surf on Tuesday belied the fury that Irma was forecast to bring, Denise Watkins, 52, of Midlothian, Texas, was reconsidering her vacation plans. At 8 p.m. EDT (0000 GMT), Irma was about 85 miles (140 km) east of Antigua in the eastern Caribbean and moving west at 15 miles per hour (24 kph), according to the NHC. The NHC said Irma ranked as one of the five most powerful Atlantic hurricanes during the past 80 years and the strongest in the Atlantic storm outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico in NHC records. STORM UPGRADED The storm was upgraded to a Category 5, the highest NHC designation, earlier in the day. While some fluctuations in intensity are likely, Irma is expected to remain a Category 4 or 5 for the next couple of days, the Hurricane Center said. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello urged the 3.4 million residents of the U.S. territory to seek refuge in one of 460 hurricane shelters in advance of the storm and later ordered police and National Guard troops to begin evacuations of flood-prone areas in the north and east of the island. Residents of low-lying areas in densely populated Miami-Dade County were urged to move to higher ground by Wednesday as a precaution against coastal storm surges, three days before Irma was expected to make landfall in Florida. Hurricane watches were in effect for Guadeloupe, Haiti, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas.

Tribune news servicesContact Reporter Hurricane Matthew churned toward the Bahamas early Wednesday with a spreading mix of high winds, heavy rains and a dangerous storm surge, leaving widespread damage and human suffering behind in Haiti's poor, rural southwestern peninsula. At least 11 deaths had been blamed on the powerful storm during its weeklong march across the Caribbean, five of them in Haiti. But with a key bridge washed out, roads impassable and phone communications down, the western tip of Haiti was isolated and there was no word on dead and injured. Forecasters said the high winds, pounding rains and storm surge were already beginning to have an impact in the southern Bahamas as the powerful Category 3 hurricane left Haiti and eastern Cuba behind and marched toward the island chain over open waters Wednesday. A day earlier, Matthew swept across a remote area of Haiti with 145 mph winds, and government leaders said they weren't close to fully gauging the impact in the vulnerable, flood-prone country where less powerful storms have killed thousands. The hurricane also had made landfall Tuesday night near Cuba's sparsely populated eastern tip with no immediate reports of major damage. By Wednesday it was moving again over open waters on a forecast path expected to take it very near Florida's Atlantic coast by Thursday evening. At 5 a.m. EDT Matthew's eye was about 65 miles north-northwest of the tip of eastern Cuba. Matthew had top sustained winds of 125 mph and was heading north at 10 mph as it was taking aim at the Bahamas. Oct. 7, 2016.

Business owners in South Florida beaches took last minute preparations for Hurricane Matthew on Thursday while some people were spotted watching the waves. Tropical storm conditions began spreading over the southeastern Bahamas early Wednesday, with hurricane conditions expected to follow later, the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said. Bahamas Prime Minister Perry Christie voiced concern about the potential impact on the sprawling archipelago off Florida's east coast. The hurricane center said winds had slightly decreased overnight as Matthew dropped from a Category 4 to a still powerful Category 3 storm early Wednesday. But forecasters warned such fluctuations in intensity were expected and that Matthew would remain a powerful and dangerous storm over coming days. There was growing concern on the U.S. East Coast, which was expected to come under threat after Matthew made a two-day surge up the length of the Bahamas. People raced to supermarkets, gas stations and hardware stores, buying up groceries, water, plywood, tarps, batteries and propane. Hurricane Matthew slams Haiti with torrential rain. Oct. 4, 2016.

Rick Scott urged coastal residents to prepare for the possibility of a direct hit and line up three days' worth of food, water and medicine. The White House said relief supplies were being moved to emergency staging areas in the Southeast. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she would issue an evacuation order Wednesday so 1 million people would have time to leave the coast. The Red Cross put out a call for volunteers there. In Haiti, where international aid efforts were stymied Tuesday because of the lack of access to the hardest-hit areas, many residents of flooded areas seen by Associated Press reporters were wading through shin-high waters. Muddy rivers and tributaries continued to rise as water flowed down hillsides and mountains, making more flash floods and mudslides possible even Matthew tracked away from the country. Matthew was at one point a Category 5 storm, making it the most powerful hurricane in the region in nearly a decade. It blew ashore around dawn Tuesday in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and a place where many people live in shacks of wood or concrete blocks. Mourad Wahba, U.N. secretary-general's deputy special representative for Haiti, said at least 10,000 people were in shelters and hospitals were overflowing and running short of water. Surging waters ripped away a bridge in the flooded town of Petit Goave, preventing any road travel to the hard-hit southwest. Local radio reported water shoulder high in parts of the southern city of Les Cayes. Milriste Nelson, a 65-year-old farmer in the town of Leogane, said neighbors fled when the wind tore away the corrugated metal roof on their home. His own small yard was strewn with the fruit he depends on for his livelihood. Haitian authorities had tried to evacuate people from the most vulnerable areas ahead of the storm, but many were reluctant to leave their homes. Some sought shelter only after the worst was already upon them. Rainfall totals were predicted to reach 15 to 25 inches in Haiti, with up to 40 inches in isolated places. OFFICIALS WORRIED ABOUT COMPLACENCY Hurricane Matthew's slog toward the East Coast has government officials worried about complacency, especially in South Florida, which hasn't seen a major hurricane in 11 years. South Carolina's governor said she would issue an evacuation order Wednesday so that 1 million people would have time to leave the coast, and residents up and down the Eastern seaboard flocked to hardware stores, grocery aisles and gas stations to prepare for the powerful storm. A dangerous Category 3 storm with sustained winds of 125 mph, Matthew was bearing down on the southern Bahamas early Wednesday amid forecasters' predictions it would be very near Florida's Atlantic coast by Thursday evening. Already the hurricane was spreading high winds, heavy rain and a dangerous storm surge ahead of it on its approach to the Bahamas, forecasters said. It added that while maximum winds decreased slightly in recent hours, the fluctuation in intensity was expected and some slight strengthening is forecast in coming days. Officials hope to avoid a repeat of Hurricanes Wilma and Katrina, which caused major damage to South Florida in 2005, and Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm, leveled much of the city of Homestead in 1992. Curbelo, a Republican, said he wants assurances that the federal, state and local governments are working together. The Miami forecasters issued a hurricane warning for the area north of Golden Beach near Fort Lauderdale to Sebastian Inlet, meaning hurricane force winds of 74 mph or higher are expected within two days. A hurricane watch is also in effect from Sebastian Inlet to Fernandina Beach, meaning hurricane force winds could occur. During rush hour Tuesday, long lines formed at gas stations in Charleston, South Carolina, snarling traffic as lines snaked out of gas stations and into travel lanes. At one gas station in Mount Pleasant, the line reached about a quarter mile down the street. In South Florida, lines at grocery stores were heavier than usual and some essentials were in short supply. When Simone Corrado and her husband tried to buy water at their Publix in Davie near Fort Lauderdale, they mostly found empty shelves. There were a few bottles of high-end water brands, but there was so much empty shelf space that Corrado lay down and fully stretched out on the bottom shelf. Florida Gov. Rick Scott warned residents they must be prepared to take a direct hit and evacuation orders could be issued as early as Tuesday. Hurricane Hermine became the first to strike Florida since Wilma in 2005 when it hit the eastern Panhandle on Sept. 2 as a Category 1 storm, causing one death, storm surge damage to beachfront homes and downed trees and powerlines. That 11-year lull between storms hitting Florida was the longest on record. The last storm to hit Florida from the Atlantic side was Katrina, which struck on its way to devastating the Gulf coast. It concluded a two-year span when a record eight hurricanes hit the state. Governors in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina declared states of emergency, and the White House said President Barack Obama canceled a campaign and health care events in Florida on Wednesday and would instead visit the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for an update. Some airlines let passengers change travel plans without penalty if their trip might be affected by Matthew. Near Fort Lauderdale, The Home Depot in Davie briefly ran out of propane for gas barbecues and the supply of batteries was dwindling. People bought plywood to cover windows, tarps to put over outdoor furniture and coolers for food storage. Anesthesiologist Darby Lipka lugged a 20-pound propane tank across the parking lot, saying he had already purchased food and water. Haley said state officials would reverse lanes on major evacuation routes in South Carolina. It would be the first major evacuation since Hurricane Floyd in 1999, when the governor at the time didn't reverse the lanes and Interstate 26 became a parking lot.

Some three million people on the U.S. southeast coast faced an urgent evacuation order Thursday as Hurricane Matthew bore down on Florida. Matthew hit them as a Category Four hurricane but has since been downgraded to three, on a scale of five, by the US National Hurricane Center. The first evacuations were ordered in the United States as coastal residents prepared to escape the approaching monster storm, expected off the East Coast later this week. The dangerous Category 4 storm blew ashore around dawn in Haiti. It unloaded heavy rain as it swirled on toward a lightly populated part of Cuba and the Bahamas. Hurricane Matthew roared into the southwestern coast of the island of Hispaniola with devastating storm conditions as it headed north toward Cuba and the eastern coast of Florida. As the Category 4 hurricane creeps closer, Cuba, in the likely path of destruction, ordered the evacuation of more than 250,000 people from the east of the island. Hurricane Matthew took aim at densely populated Haiti and Jamaica on Monday, packing winds that could sweep away flimsy buildings and bringing torrential rain that could trigger deadly landslides and floods. As the powerful storm churned north, officials in both countries scrambled to protect buildings and move people out of danger zones to shelters. All rights reserved."}

Irma killed at least three people in St. Thomas and St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the office of Gov. Kenneth Mapp said. A French official previously cited the death toll at eight. Early Wednesday, one person was killed on the tiny island of Barbuda. Nearly every building there was damaged when Irma's core crossed almost directly over and about 60 percent of its roughly 1,400 residents were left homeless, Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne told The Associated Press. Irma's 185-mph maximum winds inched toward the strongest on record: the 190-mph pummeling that Hurricane Allen gave the Caribbean, northern Mexico and southern Texas in 1980. Puerto Rico hadn't seen a hurricane of Irma's magnitude since San Felipe in 1928, which killed 2,748 people in Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico and Florida. It is then expected to move north along or very near the East Coast on Sunday night into Monday, with a second landfall projected between Savannah, Georgia, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, late Monday or early Tuesday.

As Irma advanced over neighboring Ciego de Avila province, 16- to 23-foot waves (5 to 7 meters) were recorded. As the storm headed westward, the possibility of even bigger waves and greater flooding was high along the northern Cuban coast, including in Havana, the agency said. Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to hit Camaguey in 85 years, according to the province's state media radio station. Damage was reported in all municipalities in Camaguey, the station said, mostly in the form of torn-off roofs, damage to buildings, downed trees and loss of electricity. Irma's eye was due to strike part of the Florida Keys on Sunday morning before driving up the state's southwestern coast by Sunday afternoon, according to the hurricane center. Forecasters and Florida officials issued dire warnings urging residents in Irma's path to evacuate immediately. About 6.3 million people in the state had been ordered to leave, officials said. Devastation left in Irma's wake Of the 24 deaths blamed on Irma in the Caribbean, nine were in unspecified French territories, one in Barbuda, one in Anguilla, two in Dutch-administered St. Maarten, four in the British Virgin Islands, four in the US Virgin Islands, and three in Puerto Rico. Antigua, Barbuda's sister island and home to about 80,000 people, was spared the brunt of the storm. Many residents there have been evacuated ahead of Jose. Looting broke out on the island, home to about 72,000 people, and security forces were deployed to deal with the problem, French and Dutch authorities said Friday. Pictures from St. Thomas, the most populated of the US Virgin Islands and a popular tourist destination, showed extensive damage. Puerto Rico, an unincorporated US territory, managed to avoid a direct hit from Irma but suffered strong winds and torrential rains. Hundreds of thousands of people remained without power on Friday. Strong winds and heavy rain also lashed the Dominican Republic, Haiti and the low-lying Turks and Caicos Islands Thursday into Friday.

As it plowed through northern Florida Monday morning, however, it weakened to a tropical storm. At 8 a.m., the storm was centered 105 miles north-northwest of Tampa. Almost the entire state of Georgia was covered in heavy rain. Dangerous flash flooding due to heavy rain and storm surge was occurring around downtown Jacksonsville. And thanks to Irma's large wind field, a broad area was experiencing tropical-storm force winds and gusts up to hurricane strength. Irma's peak winds of 70 mph make it a strong tropical storm, but much less intense than the Category 4 hurricane it was just one day earlier with 130 mph winds. The National Hurricane Center said Irma is expected to weaken to a tropical depression by Tuesday afternoon. Coastal waters could still rise well above normally dry land along the coast of Florida, Georgia, and southern South Carolina, resulting in areas of flooding. The Weather Service urged affected residents to move to higher ground. The Weather Service reported the storm surge flooding in Jacksonville set an all-time record. Central Florida Irma's eyewall passed on the east side of Sarasota around 10 p.m. and was about 60 miles north of Tampa around 5 a.m., producing wind gusts around 75 mph. Even on Central Florida's east coast, tropical-storm force winds and hurricane-force gusts were fairly widespread Sunday evening. At St. Lucie, a gust reached 99 mph and Cape Canaveral gusted to 79 mph. Southwest Florida The worst winds had passed this region just prior to 9:30 p.m. Sunday but gusty showers continued on the storm's backside. Irma's eyewall passed through Fort Myers and Cape Coral just before 7 p.m., producing wind gusts of 88 and 101 mph and then passed on the west side of Port Charlotte between 8 and 9 p.m. Then the calm eye moved overhead. Aerial video from inside eye of Hurricane Irma. But forecasters warned residents that shortly after the storm's center passed to the north and winds blew back onshore, waters would rush back in rapidly causing severe inundation. In Ft. Myers, waters levels were rising through 10 p.m., but not as dramatically as they had in Naples. Southeast Florida In Southeast Florida, spiral bands continued to unleash tropical-storm-force winds. Even into the evening, winds were gusting up to 60 to 75 mph around Miami and West Palm Beach (7 p.m. gust of 75 mph), but they weren't as strong as earlier. Miami International Airport clocked a gust to 94 mph and an isolated gust hit 100 mph at the University of Miami. Also during the afternoon the seas had risen several feet above normally dry land. Social media photos and videos showed water pouring through Miami's streets, in between high-rises, amid sideways sheets of rains. This is Miami right now. Gusts still reached 50 to 60 mph as of 7:45 p.m. Early Sunday afternoon, the maximum surge at Cudjoe Key was estimated at 10 feet. Statewide About 3.6 million customers were without power. Particularly in South and Central Florida, torrential rain had fallen, with widespread totals of 6 to 10 inches and pockets up to 10 to 14 inches. Numerous flash flood warnings had been issued. Storm warnings in effect and predicted surge height and winds Tropical storm warnings cover much of central and northern Florida (except for the far west panhandle), the entire Georgia coast, and the southern coast of South Carolina. A storm surge warning remained in effect for much of Florida's west coast and northeast coast and extended north along the Georgia coast and southern South Carolina coast. Effects on Florida Conditions will continue to deteriorate Monday over Florida in the north part of the state as Irma plows northward. Conditions will slowly improve to the south. Hazard threats: Rain, tornadoes, wind, surge The northeast portion of Florida will be spared the worst of Irma but won't escape unscathed. Sustained tropical-force winds of 40 to 55 mph will overspread the area from Daytona Beach to Jacksonville by Sunday evening, with the worst winds (gusts up to 70 mph) occurring overnight. As with other parts of the state, the tornado threat will peak overnight on Sunday as Irma's storm center tracks northward. Storm-surge values will be elevated (two to four feet) but should result in only minor to moderate coastal flooding. Hazard threats: Wind, rain and, at the coast, storm surge Hurricane warnings extend well into Georgia, covering over half of the state. Parts of southern South Carolina also are under a hurricane warning, with Irma poised to maintain its hurricane-force strength for several hours after landfall. Sustained tropical force winds of 25 to 45 mph will spread over Georgia from south to north starting late Sunday night. The strongest sustained winds (40 to 50 mph) with gusts of 60-plus mph will move in on early Monday morning, lasting through Monday evening. This includes Atlanta, which is under a tropical-storm warning, where sustained winds of 25 to 40 mph with gusts up to 60 mph will occur from about 10 p.m. Sunday night to about 5 p.m. Monday afternoon. This could lead to downed trees and outages. Wind gusts on Monday afternoon will be well into the tropical storm force range for all of Georgia and South Carolina. Of particular concern is the duration of the storm surge. Persistent onshore winds will extend the surge component here, with elevated water levels potentially lasting up to 36 hours. Winds over the Keys raged, gusting to at least 94 mph in Key West (before the wind instrument failed) and up to 120 mph in Big Pine Key. Witness video showed the rising storm surge flooding Key West streets. Before its encounter with the Keys, Irma made landfall on the north coast of Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane just after 9 p.m. Friday, with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph. It became that country's first Category 5 hurricane since 1924. Fueled by the extremely warm ocean temperatures, Irma reintensified to the maximum hurricane classification level after weakening slightly on Friday afternoon. As it scraped Cuba's north coast early Saturday, it produced a sustained wind gust of 118 mph, and a gust to 159 mph was reported at Falla, Cuba, in the eyewall of the hurricane. Via NASA On Friday, before making landfall along Cuba's north-central coast, Irma passed north of Haiti and then between Cuba's northeast coast and the Central Bahamas. Thursday evening, the center of the storm passed very close to the Turks and Caicos, producing potentially catastrophic Category 5 winds. The storm surge was of particular concern, as the water had the potential to rise 16 to 20 feet above normally dry land in coastal sections north of the storm center, causing extreme inundation. On Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the hurricane passed directly over Barbuda and St. Martin in the northern Leeward Islands, the strongest hurricane recorded in that region and tied with the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane as the strongest Atlantic storm to strike land. As Barbuda took a direct hit, the weather station there clocked a wind gust to 155 mph before it went offline. The storm also passed directly over Anguilla and St. Martin early Wednesday, causing severe damage. Among the most intense storms on record, it trails only Hurricane Allen in 1980, which had winds of 190 mph. It is tied for second-most intense with Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane. The storm maintained maximum wind speeds of at least 180 mph for 37 hours, longer than any storm on Earth on record, passing Super Typhoon Haiyan, the previous record-holder (24 hours). Late Tuesday, its pressure dropped to 914 millibars (the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm), ranking as the lowest of any storm on record outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the Atlantic basin. It ranks as the seventh-lowest pressure of any U.S. landfalling storm. Capital Weather Gang hurricane expert Brian McNoldy contributed to this report.

Sailboats on Grove Key Marina were flipped. Once-idyllic parks looked like desolate war zones. Debris was everywhere. Large trees toppled over by their roots. By Monday afternoon, the water had mostly receded, but power had yet to be restored. Tendrils of the storm covered parts of Canada and Florida at the same time.

Gov. Rick Scott (R) sounded dire warnings about the storm, urging residents in evacuation zones to leave their homes immediately. The storm could potentially make a second landfall further north on Sunday. Acting Deputy Director Mark DeMaria prepares to discuss Hurricane Irma on a live broadcast at the National Hurricane Center on Saturday. The National Weather Service said southwestern Florida could see storm surges up to 15 feet if peak surge happens during high tide. A storm surge warning is in effect for much of the Florida peninsula. At least 50,000 people are staying in 260 state shelters, Scott said. He implored nurses to volunteer throughout Florida; the state desperately needs 1,000 nurses in its special-needs shelters. By Saturday afternoon, storm conditions had swept into Miami, now a ghost metropolis. There was no traffic on typically jammed roads and highways. Almost all stores appeared to be closed. By midday, dozens of people crowded Vicky Bakery on Coral Way, the one place for miles that was open. In downtown Miami, cranes spun like toys. Emergency managers in Monroe County, which encompasses the Keys, were forced by the track of the storm to abandon their Emergency Operations Center in Marathon, in the Middle Keys, and relocate to relatively high ground in Key Largo, at the northern end of the island chain. Downey said he feared that the storm could knock out the Overseas Highway, which would hamper rescue efforts. That would necessitate mobilizing by air and water. He said he spoke Saturday to a counterpart in Marco Island, a small community south of Naples. Floridians start the long process of damage assessment.

In Estero, on the west coast of Florida, thousands of people wrapped around the massive Germain Arena, which officials opened as a shelter Saturday and has a capacity of 7,000 to 8,000. At least six ambulances have responded to people who were overcome in the muggy, 90-degree heat. Troopers, the National Guard and local police sought out people in wheelchairs and moved them to the front of the line, said Lt. Greg Bueno, public information officer for the Florida Highway Patrol. Leaning on a cane, Betty Sellers, 68, and her son, Doug, 49, got in line at 9:30 a.m. and were still 100 people away from the front doors. Officials at the Collier County emergency operations center in Naples said 15,000 people have filled its shelters, but they are trying to expand space in each location to accommodate more. The county said it will be difficult for it to house everyone who needs or wants to evacuate to shelters and urged people who can find shelter with friends or family to go there. Lee County Manager Roger Desjarlais said Saturday afternoon that the county is sheltering 22,000 people. The two counties combined have a population of about 1 million. Officials are also concerned that wind gusts will send water over the Herbert Hoover Dike that holds back Lake Okeechobee, which covers more than 700 square miles. Evacuations have been ordered for cities and towns on the south side of the lake in Hendry, Palm Beach and Glades counties. The storm has already heavily damaged some Caribbean islands, killing at least 22 people. In St. Martin, 25 U.S. citizens were evacuated by a C-130 military aircraft Friday from Sonesta Great Bay Beach Resort. Resort officials said another evacuation is expected. But with the airport seriously damaged, there was no way out. They ate a lunch of sausage pizza, canned corn, applesauce and milk or juice. Mayor Mark Fisher stopped by to thank people for evacuating to the shelter. It is one of 20 set up by Broward County. Another is specifically for people with special medical needs. Infants, parents and grandparents all crammed into an at-capacity emergency shelter at the Miami-Dade County Fair and Exposition. But some locals refused to budge.

The tidal surge sent damaged boats rushing more than three blocks onto downtown streets in St. Marys, just north of the Georgia-Florida state line, St. Marys Police Lt. Shannon Brock said. Downtown Atlanta hotels remained full of evacuees. Many milled about the CNN Center, escaping crowded hotel rooms in search of open restaurants.

Getty Images The fourth hurricane of 2017, Irma, is heading toward the US, and officials in Florida are asking residents to be prepared to evacuate as it approaches. As of Friday afternoon, Irma had slammed into several Caribbean islands as a Category 5 storm, killing at least 23 people. Although the storm's exact path is not yet know, some meteorologists have said it's possible it could hit Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, and Alabama this weekend. In these states, residents are doing their best to prepare their homes to mitigate flood and wind damage, like securing rain gutters, clearing clogged drains, installing sump pumps, unplugging appliances, and reinforcing doors and windows. According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), there is one thing you shouldn't do, however: Apply duct tape to glass windows. Now a Category 4 storm, Irma has sustained wind speeds of 150 mph, with the potential to make homes unlivable for months. If extreme winds bust through windows with tape, it could cause the glass to break into larger, deadlier shards. And though these are not a last-minute solution, you could also invest in wind-resistant windows or pull-down storm shutters, which need to be retro-fitted ahead of time. All rights reserved.

Follow the latest developments on our new live blog: Hurricane Irma live updates: Florida evacuates millions as superstorm makes landfall in Cuba Read more Facebook Twitter Google plus 2.49am EDT 02:49 What we know so far Claire Phipps Hurricane Irma, which briefly dipped to category four intensity, is now back up to category five and has made landfall in Cuba. Irma is now forecast to hit the Florida Keys on Sunday morning, moving over south-west Florida by Sunday afternoon, then crossing the entire state over approximately 30 hours of ferocious winds and rains. On Saturday, Irma continues to rake the north coast of Cuba, where it first hit the Camaguey archipelago on Friday night. It is the first category five storm to make landfall in Cuba for almost a century. Outer rain bands have already reached the peninsula. A curfew comes into effect in Palm Beach from 3pm on Saturday. Florida governor Rick Scott warned on Friday: If you are planning to leave and do not leave tonight, you will have to ride out this extremely dangerous storm at your own risk. In Georgia, 540,000 people on the coast received mandatory evacuation orders. The Bahamas meteorological office said the main island of New Providence had been spared the worst as Irma passed close by, but the southern Bahamas had been more badly hit. At least 23 people have been confirmed killed in the Caribbean so far. The first victim of Irma was two-year-old Carl Junior Francis in Barbuda. Eleven died on French St Martin and St Barts, four in the US Virgin Islands, three on Puerto Rico, two on Dutch St Maarten and one in Anguilla. A teenage surfer died off Barbados in waves churned up by Irma, and four deaths were reported on the British Virgin Islands that have yet to be corroborated. On the forecast track, the centre of Irma will move near the north coast of Cuba today, near the Florida Keys Sunday morning, and then near the southwest coast of Florida Sunday afternoon.

Updated at 1.23am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus 1.04am EDT 01:04 Irma brushes Florida The outer bands of Hurricane Irma have reached the US, with rain and increased wind speeds in south Florida and the Keys. The centre of the storm remains over northern Cuba, where the Camaguey archipelago has borne the brunt. September 9, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus 12.53am EDT 00:53 Martin Farrer Hurricane Jose has moved closer to category five strength, with tops winds of 155mph (250kmh) as it heads towards the eastern Caribbean islands ravaged by Hurricane Irma. Jose was about 265 miles (430km) east-south-east of the northern Leeward Islands early on Saturday and is forecast to hit the outlying Caribbean islands later in the day. A hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua, while tropical storm watch was in effect for Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis, British Virgin Islands, and St Thomas and St John. Although the hurricane itself is forecast to arrive on Sunday morning, Florida will be seeing extremely strong winds from Saturday morning, sweeping up through the state. Meteorologists warned that by Saturday morning scenes of far greater devastation were sure to emerge as Irma worked her way along the northern coast westward through Sancti Spiritus and Villa Clara provinces. The area is home to pristine keys with more than 50 hotels and fine beaches, vital money-makers for the cash-strapped government. Residents in the central province of Camaguey hunkered down on Friday night. Those who have not evacuated are urged to seek safe shelter. Senior meteorological officer Elmo Burke says outer rain bands from Jose will reach St Kitts & Nevis overnight and into Saturday, with its closest passing late afternoon on Saturday. Sunday, at least, will bring better weather conditions. Scott says evacuation orders are also being issued further up the west coast of the state, given forecasts predicting that Irma could now track west. There are currently no shelters on the vulnerable Florida Keys, whose residents have been told to go. No services will be available at those shelters, as most officials will have left the Keys. Hurricane Katia, which is category one, has just made landfall in Mexico, north of Tecolutla, with wind speeds of 75mph (120kph).

People shop in a supermarket, one of the few open, with limited electricity three days after Hurricane Irma swept through the area on September 13, 2017 in Naples, Florida. Utility companies are working to rapidly restore power to the battered Florida Keys, as frustrated residents who evacuated emerge from shelters ready to go home. Parts of central and southern Florida will be a sweltering 90 degrees for several days, with humidity making it feel like the mid-90s. Relief is days away for those suffering the high temperatures. Those on the west coast, where Hurricane Irma made landfall, will likely have power restored by September 22, according to Florida Power & Light Co. Customers who lost electricity on Florida's eastern side will likely have it restored by this weekend because fewer electrical poles came down than in other parts of the state, the company said. Massive power outages also crippled other states, including Georgia, where hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses organizations did not have power Wednesday.

As they wait, they have 17 people living under one roof. 'There's nothing here' Power is just one of many concerns for the residents. Others don't have access to their homes due to debris and piles of brush blocking roads. Frustrations grew Wednesday when some residents tried to go home along a two-lane stretch of highway through the Florida Keys, but were told it's not safe enough to return home. In Big Pine Key, houses were reduced to splinters. Boats were scattered across land -- a reminder that streets turned into rivers when the hurricane hit. Richard Tabacco stayed with his family on the island through the storm. They are all OK -- a generator is keeping them cool, he said. But he is warning residents who evacuated to stay away. There's no stores. There's no electricity. There's no cellphone service. Still, anxious residents wanted to return home. At a checkpoint on Lower Matecumbe Key, sheriff's deputies turned away people trying to get to their homes in the lower Keys. Instead of going back, many pulled their cars over to the side of the highway, sat and waited. A deputy at the checkpoint said they were trying to keep people safe, but some residents said they knew the risks and were willing to accept them. Many wanted to survey the damage; others wanted to prevent looting. Deadly storm At least 33 storm-related deaths have been reported on the US mainland, according to local officials. They include 26 in Florida, four in South Carolina and three in Georgia. The total number doesn't include the nursing home deaths, which police said are under investigation. The nursing home deaths Wednesday in Hollywood prompted officials to call for action.

Hurricane Irma is now stronger than Katrina was at its peak Leanna Garfield Sep. 5, 2017, 3:37 PM createPerformanceMark('first image displayed'); Hurricane Irma as seen from a NOAA satellite on Tuesday. Twelve years later, Hurricane Irma will most likely descend on the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, among other locations. The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for these areas, where Irma could strike as early as Wednesday morning. While Irma's ultimate scale is still unknown, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has detected sustained winds of 185 mph. As Eric Holthaus, a meteorologist, noted on Twitter, that's at least 10 mph faster than the wind speeds Katrina packed at its peak. Katrina, one of the five deadliest hurricanes in US history, started over the Bahamas on August 23, 2005. A Category 3 storm, it then headed west toward Mississippi, Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, and southeastern Louisiana. As of Tuesday morning, Irma is a Category 5 hurricane and one of the strongest ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean. The current hurricane-category system classifies storms based on wind speed, and it doesn't account for rain or storm-surge levels. Even a Category 1 or Category 2 hurricane can be catastrophic if it dumps enough rain on a city that did not adequately prepare for severe flooding. All rights reserved.

Haiti began cleaning up and counting its losses Wednesday after Hurricane Matthew killed at least 19 people there, six others elsewhere in the Caribbean and left a trail of destruction before pushing toward the Bahamas. The damage from the most powerful Atlantic tropical storm in almost a decade was so bad that it forced Haiti's electoral council to postpone Sunday's presidential election.

U.N. officials described Matthew as the worst humanitarian crisis to hit Haiti since the 2010 earthquake.

Current forecasts put almost the entirety of the Florida peninsula in the path of the storm, which made landfall in the Caribbean with wind speeds of 185 mph. The threat of the Category 4 storm, the second highest rung on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, is grave enough that FPL plans to shut its two nuclear power plants in the state, and officials warned that it may have to rebuild parts of its power system, which could take weeks.

The other nuclear plant, St. Lucie, is on a barrier island on the east coast about 120 miles (193 km) north of Miami. Most Florida residents have not experienced a major storm since 2005, when total outages peaked around 3.6 million during Hurricane Wilma. Some of those outages lasted for weeks.

FPL, a unit of Florida energy company NextEra Energy Inc , restored service to most customers affected by Matthew in just two days. Other utilities in the Sunshine State said in statements that they had also invested in intelligent, self-healing devices. Smart meters allow utilities to see outages as they occur, rather than waiting on customer calls, and utilities also use automated devices that can re-energize lines without damage that were taken offline because of contact with trees or other objects, said Jay Apt, director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center in Pittsburgh.

Communications with areas already hit by Irma have been difficult, and information on damage trickled out. However, authorities cautioned the death toll is likely to rise. French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told France Info radio that the toll on St. Martin and St. Bart's will likely climb as rescue teams have yet to finish their inspection of the islands.

But when asked about people in South Florida who intend to ride out the storm at home, Long was blunt. Mark DeMaria, acting deputy director of the hurricane center, said Friday afternoon that the latest models showed the storm track shifting slightly to the west, putting southwest Florida in particular jeopardy for the most violent winds, while all of South Florida will have significant impacts. In addition to having intense power, Irma also is an immense storm, with forecasters reporting hurricane-force winds extending some 70 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extending as far as 195 miles out.

Here are all the areas still in Hurricane Irma's path and when the storm could arrive Rebecca Harrington Sep. 11, 2017, 10:15 AM NOAA Hurricane Irma started hitting the Leeward Islands, the chain of islands separating the Caribbean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean, early Wednesday. The storm caused severe damage in Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, St. Martin, St. Barthelemy, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Florida Keys, and southern Florida. The storm made landfall in the Florida Keys as a Category 4 on Sunday morning. By Monday, it was a tropical storm heading for Georgia. Hurricane Irma, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded, started slamming the southeastern Caribbean islands early Wednesday as a Category 5 storm with devastating winds, heavy rains, and catastrophic storm surges. As of 8 a.m. ET on Monday, the tropical storm was battering northern Florida with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph. The National Hurricane Center said the hurricane was cruising northwest toward Georgia at 18 mph. What's next NOAA The National Weather Service's latest forecast still has many parts of Florida, as well as most of Georgia and South Carolina, in the storm's crosshairs. The storm is expected to travel across Georgia on Monday, Alabama on Tuesday, and reach Tennessee as a tropical depression by early Wednesday morning. Life-threatening winds NOAA While Hurricane Harvey brought devastating floods late last month, Irma's biggest threat has been its strong winds and storm surge. Irma is now a tropical storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale, which measures a hurricane's strength based on its wind speeds. The scale goes up to 5, but if it had been extended to classify Irma's highest sustained wind speeds of 185 mph, the storm could have been considered Category 6 at one point. That's not an official designation, though. Some hurricane-force gusts above 75 mph are still being reported in northern Florida. The winds have also been churning up tornadoes, and some counties in northeast Florida and southeast Georgia and South Carolina could face tornadoes. Florida's peninsula is only about 140 miles across at its widest, so Irma engulfed the entire state. Dangerous flooding Many areas, including Miami and the southwest coast where the hurricane made landfall on Sunday, saw storm surges many feet high, which flooded roads and beached boats. The National Hurricane Center suggests that if the storm surge hits at high tide, water levels could rise 2-4 feet above ground from Cape Sable to Captiva and in and around Tampa Bay, 3-5 feet from Captiva to Ana Maria Island, 1-2 feet from North Miami Beach to Cape Sable including the Florida Keys, 4-6 feet on the east coast of Florida from South Santee River to Fernandina Beach, 4-feet on the west coast of the state from Clearwater Beach to Ochlockonee River, and 3-5 feet from Fernandina Beach to Jupiter Inlet. The NHC expects an additional inch of rain in the Florida Keys, and another 1 to 3 inches in central Florida. Northern Florida into southern Georgia can expect another 3 to 6 inches, bringing the storm totals to 8 to 15 inches. Central Georgia, eastern Alabama, and southern South Carolina could get 3 to inches of rain, with some areas seeing up to 10 inches. The Florida Panhandle, western Alabama, northern Mississippi, southern Tennessee, northern Georgia, northern South Carolina and western North Carolina could also get 2 to 4 inches. Tracking the path Irma's possible paths. The red line is the NHC's official forecast, and is the one to watch. NOAA Though Irma's catastrophic hurricane status was reclassified to a tropical storm by Monday, forecasters advise residents to heed the advice of local officials and get ready if they are in the projected path of the storm. An estimated 7 million people were ordered to evacuate in Florida. The Florida Keys and the southern tip of the state have most likely seen the worst effects of the storm as Irma continues to weaken over land. Forecasters are predicting the storm will travel over Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, and parts of Missouri and Arkansas. But Irma is so big that the Carolinas are projected to see heavy rainfall and even storm surge on the coasts. All rights reserved.

Gas stations reported low fuel stocks and grocery stores ran out of bottled water. They belong to NextEra, a utility with about 5 million electricity customers in Florida.

Officials across Florida responded to the dire forecasts by slowly shutting down the contours of daily life. But it was still not clear Wednesday how much of the state could be imperiled by Irma. Stocks of water and flashlights at grocery stores were wiped out, and gas was becoming scarce.

Unleashing 185-mph winds and torrential rainfall, Irma has already caused death and destruction on small islands in the Caribbean and is barreling toward major population centers. States of emergency have already been declared in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Florida and South Carolina. When meteorologists try to determine the strength of a hurricane and its potential damage to infrastructure, they rely on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale ranking. Here are the categories and their potential for damage, according to the National Hurricane Center: Category 1: Winds range from 74 mph to 95 mph, with the potential to uproot trees and damage roofs and power lines. Damage to property is also much more likely and power outages are expected. Wind speed could go up to 129 mph, resulting in damaged buildings and power outrages that could last for days. Category 4: Wind speeds can go up to 156 mph. Hurricane Harvey was a category 4 storm when it struck Texas. Category 5: Storms with winds of 157 mph or higher are ranked in this category. Hurricane Andrew, one of the most destructive hurricanes recorded, was a Category 5 storm that struck Florida in 1992, killing 25 people and destroying 28,000 homes. Hurricane season officially lasts from June 1 to Nov. 30, but the peak of the season, from mid-August to early September, is when strong hurricanes such as Irma typically occur. There are certain ingredients needed to create a powerful hurricane. For instance, the more strong winds change direction, the more they prevent a hurricane from organizing. Less change in wind direction allows the storm to brew and gain strength, according to John Brost, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. A hurricane also gains strength when it passes over warm water in deep parts of the ocean, and waters have been warm this season. The speed in which a hurricane travels also affects its intensity. Hurricane Irma is moving at around 16 mph, slow enough to utilize the energy it gets from the warm water and intensify before it hits land, Brost said. Hurricane Allen in 1980 was the strongest Atlantic hurricane, with winds reaching 190 mph. Another indicator about how strong a hurricane can become is the pressure at the eye of the storm. The lower the pressure, the stronger the hurricane. Hurricane Irma ranks at the 12th-lowest pressure of all time for hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, and Hurricane Allen ranked as fifth, said Brost. Hurricane Wilma in 2005 came in as No. 1 in terms of lowest pressure. Thank you for your support. If you are not, please consider subscribing today.

The center is out by the Turnpike, on the campus of Florida International University, a location that puts it much further from the coast than the old headquarters in Coral Gables, which was badly damaged during Hurricane Andrew. The forecasters here are giving regular updates on Irma and taking turns giving TV interviews. The place will get busier in the next few days, and on Saturday night will go into lockdown, with metal shutters enclosing the doors and everyone in for the night until the storm passes. Irma remains on track to hit South Florida, and on Thursday, the center posted a hurricane watch for coastal Florida all the way from Jupiter Inlet in northern Palm Beach County down around the tip of the peninsula to Bonita Beach in southwest Florida just north of Naples. That includes the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee. A storm surge watch has also been posted. So even within the hurricane there are gradations of violence.

Haiti began cleaning up and counting its losses Wednesday after Hurricane Matthew killed at least 19 people there, six others elsewhere in the Caribbean and left a trail of destruction before pushing toward the Bahamas. The damage from the most powerful Atlantic tropical storm in almost a decade was so bad that it forced Haiti's electoral council to postpone Sunday's presidential election. Related: Thousands of Americans Head Inland to Escape Hurricane Matthew Civil defense officials said many homes had been destroyed or damaged, especially in the southwestern corner of the country. U.N. officials described Matthew as the worst humanitarian crisis to hit Haiti since the 2010 earthquake. Fourteen of the deaths were in the town of Petit Goave, where a key bridge linking the city to the rest of the country collapsed, Mayor Jean Samson Limomgy told NBC News. Haiti's civil protection agency confirmed five other storm-related deaths Wednesday, one of them that of a fisherman who drowned in rough water in Saint Jean du Sud, in the southern part of the country. People ride through a flooded street in Grand Goave, Haiti, on Wednesday after Hurricane Matthew.

Nassau looks to be very close to the center of Matthew on Thursday morning, with devastating effects in the event of a landfall. Thursday morning: Some strengthening, with the worst conditions occurring in Nassau. Thursday afternoon and evening: Matthew will be over the northern Bahamas, with some rain reaching southern Florida. Friday morning: Highest impacts near Melbourne, Fla., with hurricane conditions and possible landfall. Friday afternoon and evening: Central coastal Florida experiencing hurricane conditions through the day. Saturday morning: Depending on the position, coastal South Carolina (around Charleston) or Savannah, Ga., could have strong wind and rain. Saturday afternoon and evening: Matthew could be moving eastward, with Myrtle Beach, S.C., feeling lesser impacts. Evacuations were already underway in South Carolina and Florida, where states of emergencies were declared earlier this week.

Before the storm hit, many residents who lived close to the water went farther inland. Cuban officials said about 35,000 residents either were moved to higher ground with their families or were placed in shelters run by the state. Matthew was classified as a category 3 hurricane Wednesday morning as it moved back out over the ocean toward the Bahamas at about 12 mph, with maximum sustained winds near 115 mph. Matthew was set to move through the central Bahamas overnight Wednesday, bringing 8 to 12 inches of rain, with up to 15 inches in isolated areas. Boat workers tie lines Wednesday ahead of Hurricane Matthew's arrival at the harbor in Nassau, Bahamas. R.

Hurricane Hazards While hurricanes pose the greatest threat to life and property, tropical storms and depression also can be devastating. The primary hazards from tropical cyclones (which include tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes) are storm surge flooding, inland flooding from heavy rains, destructive winds, tornadoes, and high surf and rip currents. Storm surge is the abnormal rise of water generated by a storm's winds. This hazard is historically the leading cause of hurricane related deaths in the United States. Storm surge and large battering waves can result in large loss of life and cause massive destruction along the coast. Storm surge can travel several miles inland, especially along bays, rivers, and estuaries. Flooding from heavy rains is the second leading cause of fatalities from landfalling tropical cyclones. Widespread torrential rains associated with these storms often cause flooding hundreds of miles inland. This flooding can persist for several days after a storm has dissipated. Winds from a hurricane can destroy buildings and manufactured homes. Signs, roofing material, and other items left outside can become flying missiles during hurricanes. Tornadoes can accompany landfalling tropical cyclones. These tornadoes typically occur in rain bands well away from the center of the storm. Dangerous waves produced by a tropical cyclone's strong winds can pose a significant hazard to coastal residents and mariners. These waves can cause deadly rip currents, significant beach erosion, and damage to structures along the coastline, even when the storm is more than a 1,000 miles offshore. Please Contact Us."}

Ike was a strong Category 2 hurricane at landfall near Galveston. Before Wilma, other recent major hurricane landfalls on the U.S. include Rita (2005), Katrina (2005), Dennis (2005), Jeanne (2004), Ivan (2004), and Charley (2004). The category of a storm is based solely on the maximum wind speed somewhere in the storm. It has nothing to do with the size, the flooding rainfall, the inundating storm surge, the death toll, or the economic toll. Major hurricanes are in a league of their own due to the combination of the all worst of hurricane-related hazards. A tropical cyclone of any intensity, even a depression, can generate tremendous rainfall and cause inland flooding; Irene is a great example of that. Category 1 and 2 hurricanes can create substantial storm surges, as Ike and Sandy illustrated. His website hosted at RSMAS is also quite popular during hurricane season."}

He had spent years planning for such a storm and, when it hit, he stayed on the air for 23 straight hours, expertly guiding tens of thousands of South Floridians through its wrath from start to finish. His delivery was praised as steady and reassuring. Bryan Norcross Corp.). And it is for this very reason, he stressed, storm preparation is so important. Meanwhile, since 2005, not a single major hurricane, classified Category 3 or higher (on the 1-5 Saffir-Simpson intensity scale), has hit the state. Many Floridians have forgotten what a severe hurricane is like or have never experienced one. Norcross: The coverage that we provided before and during Andrew was only possible because the TV station committed to a program of backing up critical technical systems and producing in-depth specials looking at the hurricane problem. We had been working on our coverage plan for two-and-a-half years, and I had been thinking about it for some years before that. I wish I had pushed for more information from Dade County Emergency Management in the 12 hours before landfall. We had reporters all over town, and the amount of information was at times overwhelming, but, in general, we did not have an overview of how the evacuation was going, the status of the highways, reports from police and hospitals, and other information that would normally come from emergency management. There are other things that I wish had happened differently. Hurricane Andrew, 1992. As an example, nine Category 4-5 hurricanes hit South Florida in a 22-year stretch early in the 20th century. South Florida is not remotely prepared for a Category 3 or higher hurricane. In 2005, Hurricane Wilma was a Category 1 in Miami-Dade County and Category 2 in pockets of Broward and Palm Beach Counties. It ended up being the third most expensive hurricane in the history of hurricanes. The government was barely able to stabilize the situation simply due to the large number of people who were really hurting. From 1926-1969 (44 yrs), 14 Cat. 4-5 hurricanes made U.S. landfall. From 1970-2016 (47 yrs), only 3 Cat. But there are so many more people near the water, in so many more, taller buildings, with so much more wealth that any future hurricane is guaranteed to be much more difficult to manage and recover from than storms of the past. And you could never get anywhere close to 90 percent of the population to fully prepare. There are two kind of worst-case scenarios for Greater Miami-Fort Lauderdale. One is Hurricane Andrew coming ashore 10 to 12 miles farther north so that the destruction corridor includes South Beach, the Port of Miami, the banking district, the Miami International Airport, and the Coral Gables and Doral business districts. Besides the unimaginable destruction and widespread homelessness, it would be dagger to the economic heart of the region. Tourism and business would be incapacitated for an indeterminate length of time. With no jobs and housing, people would have to leave. It is impossible to imagine how the region would resurrect itself and how long it would take. The other worst-case scenario is exactly the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926. In addition, there is a little-mentioned threat from a storm that generates a storm surge in the range of 10 feet along the oceanfront. Tens or hundreds of thousands of people would likely be stranded and immobile in their buildings after the storm. People staying in high-rise buildings would be safe, if they rode out the storm in a lower-level hallway. So people will be stuck in buildings with no power, no water, likely little or no communications, and no way to get out or get people in with supplies and aid for an extended time after the storm. Your book talks a lot about this need to be ready and to plan for the worst-case scenarios. But we are often a society that tends to only respond to immediate threats, not hypotheticals. Their traditional approach has been to provide the raw elements and let communicators aggregate the facts into a message for the public. That worked when the amount of information to dispense was relatively limited and the communications channels were few.

After being devastated by Hurricane Irma, the tiny Caribbean island of Barbuda braced for its second major hurricane in four days as Hurricane Jose barreled toward its direction. What was left of Barbuda was spared from the worst of Hurricane Jose, as the Category 4 storm skirted just north of the island on Saturday. People walk along the beach of Sainte-Anne, on the French island of Guadeloupe, during high tides ahead of Hurricane Jose on Sept. 8, 2017. CNN drone footage from Barbuda on Friday showed nearly every house and building ripped open or torn apart. Trees were stripped or toppled. Windows, roofs and even walls were gone.

Florida officials say two-thirds of all power company customers statewide lacked power on Monday, totaling more than 6.5 million customer accounts. Since account can represent more than one person, the overall number may be historic, Silagy said. The utility had sent out 19,500 workers across Florida to restore power, Silagy said. The utility is also trying to secure more line and vegetation crews from out of state. Andres Nikitenko, who was in St. Petersburg, Fla., was told Monday that power could be out for a week. Torrential rain fell in the Florida panhandle, as well as Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas. Officials warned that flooding from Florida to South Carolina would pose a particular danger. Water levels continue to rise along the St. Johns River. But the storm maintained its remarkable reach, with tropical-storm-force winds reaching more than 400 miles. Thousands of flights have already been halted due to the storm. Atlanta, hundreds of miles from any coast, and more than 600 miles north of the place where Irma first hit the mainland, was placed under its first tropical-storm warning. Power was out most everywhere. The residents of the Royal Duke Trailer Court in the Allapattah neighborhood of Miami were just happy to see their homes still standing Monday. Many of them evacuated the area thinking their mobile homes would be no match for Irma, and they were surprised to see the storm weaken just enough to spare their homes. So the mood at the park on Monday was almost festive. Neighbors were out, talking in Spanish, laughing and helping one another clean up the tree debris. Their power was still out Monday, so no one wanted to be inside. Some had decided to stay in the area, riding out the storm together, making a party of it as they drank with their neighbors. Though the hurricane felled many trees on the small island and caused some property damage, predictions of potentially catastrophic storm surges and flooding did not materialize. Across Florida, more than 116,000 people packed into more than 530 shelters as of Monday afternoon, including some 75 special needs shelters with about 12,700 people inside. Hurricane Harvey also slammed into Texas as a Category 4 storm, which marked the first time on record that two storms that powerful had made landfall in the United States in a single year. Scientists say that climate change is now making such intense hurricanes more likely, since hurricanes draw strength from warmer ocean waters.

Hurricane Matthew, the most powerful Atlantic tropical storm in almost a decade, took aim for the Bahamas on Wednesday after it flooded streets, flattened homes and left a trail of destruction in Haiti. Matthew, a powerful storm with sustained winds of 140 mph, made landfall in Haiti just after 7 a.m. (8 a.m. ET) Tuesday. With communications down across much of the island, it remained too early to accurately assess the damage Wednesday morning, but civil defense officials said many homes had been destroyed or damaged in the south. Matthew brushed past the eastern tip of Cuba at about 8 p.m. ET, almost 53 years to the day after Hurricane Flora killed 2,000 Cubans on Oct. 3, 1963, the National Hurricane Center said. Landfall came at Juaco in a remote, sparsely populated part of the island, and preliminary reports indicated that the soaking rains and driving winds caused relatively little damage. High winds from Hurricane Matthew blow trees sideways Tuesday in Baracoa, Cuba. Running into Cuba also did little to weaken Matthew, whose top sustained winds had dipped only to 125 mph by 2 a.m. So far, Haiti's civil protection agency has reported just two deaths, one of them a fisherman who drowned in rough water churned up by the storm. A woman carries a child through the rain triggered Tuesday by Hurricane Matthew in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. But officials fear the death toll could rise, especially in and around the southern town of Les Cayes, which absorbed the first blow from Matthew and where hundreds were hunkering down in homes without electricity and roofs. Kevin Roth, a meteorologist for The Weather Channel, warned that by the time that back end of Matthew clears the island, Matthew could swamp Haiti's low-lying areas with up to 20 inches of rain and dump as much as 40 inches in the mountains. Photos: Hurricane Matthew Lashes Haiti, Dominican Republic Government officials and aid workers had set up a number of shelters in the major cities and pleaded with residents to low-lying areas to use them, Chris Bessey, country representative at Catholic Relief Services in Port-au-Prince, told NBC News. But many, more fearful of looters than the storm, refused to leave their properties. Elie said she ventured out of the house briefly to survey the damage, but the winds were too strong to stay outside for long. Matthew is the most powerful Atlantic storm since 2007, and the National Hurricane Center forecast that it could make landfall as early as Friday along the southern Atlantic coast. When hurricanes are particularly deadly or destructive, their names are retired. Meteorologists expect this to be the last hurricane named Matthew.

President Obama declared states of emergency in Florida and South Carolina on Thursday ahead of Hurricane Matthew reaching land. In South Carolina, Gov. Nikki Haley extended the state's mandatory evacuation to Jasper and Colleton counties. Along the coast in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, millions of residents have been urged to head inland as the powerful hurricane makes its approach. The storm is strengthening as it batters the Bahamas and moves toward Florida, the National Hurricane Center says. As of late Thursday morning, the storm is a Category 4 that's expected to near the Florida coast late Thursday and early Friday, the agency forecasts. Hundreds of people died as the storm tore through Haiti, Cuba and the Bahamas, including at least 283 dead in Haiti alone.

Not everyone is retreating from the coast: One resident of Cape Canaveral told the AP he plans to ride out the storm in his RV less than a mile from the shore. Scott exhorted any Floridians thinking similarly to change their minds immediately. Lanes of traffic on Interstate 16, the major east-west corridor leading to Savannah, are being reversed so traffic flows only westward, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Tens of thousands of people on Tybee Island and in low-lying communities had already been ordered to head inland, The Journal-Constitution said. In South Carolina, some 1.1 million people have been urged to leave their homes, The Post and Courier reports. Haley had already taken the unprecedented step of ordering all lanes of Interstate 26 in South Carolina to travel west out of Charleston. The idea for the lane reversal was developed after Hurricane Floyd in 1999, which caused massive congestion as the interstate was packed with fleeing coastal residents. So far, there haven't been reports of excessive congestion in South Carolina. But an altercation between police and a motorist over evacuation routes resulted in the exchange of gunfire late Wednesday, leaving the motorist injured, the AP reports. Floyd, the storm that caused such memorable traffic jams, ultimately veered away from South Carolina and left relatively little damage in the state. Haley told residents that it was still possible that Matthew, too, would shift away, but based on current forecasts, residents should travel at least 100 miles from the coast. On Thursday morning, Haley said some 175,000 South Carolinians had evacuated so far. Governors in all three states have declared a state of emergency in coastal regions. Meanwhile, more than 3,785 flights have been canceled in anticipation of the storm, FlightAware reports. Matthew's arrival near northern Florida and Georgia could pose an unusual threat, Bob Henson writes for Weather Underground. Whether Matthew will actually make landfall is unclear. The AP explains that the eye of the storm doesn't need to cross over land to be dangerous and destructive.

We know the ingredients that came together to make this happen: weak ambient winds in the Atlantic, very warm ocean temperatures and the fact that the storm's core has been able to stay out over the open water without making landfall on a major coast. This term describes a change in wind speed or direction with height. With exceptionally low wind shear over the Atlantic and Caribbean, the stage was set months ago for an exceptionally active season. The image below shows estimated wind shear over the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday. Green lines mean the wind shear is weak, red means it's high. Note the areas of green on the right-hand side of the image posed just off the African coast. This marks a region of weak winds aloft, making it particularly conducive to tropical cyclone development and intensification. A depiction of wind shear over the Atlantic Ocean. (University of Wisconsin) Bathlike ocean water provided a lot of fuel for Hurricane Irma to strengthen from. As ocean temperature continues to rise from climate change, this will probably influence how strong Atlantic hurricanes can become. The final reason Irma has stayed so strong is because the storm has not hit a major land area. Importantly, the storm's eye has stayed over water, which allowed it to maintain its strength as the outer winds and rain bands lashed the Lesser and Greater Antilles. Until the core reaches Florida, this storm will continue to maintain strength. Bringing it all together is the Bermuda High, which is why the storm went where it did. The Bermuda High is a ridge of high pressure centered over the central Atlantic. In addition to steering the hurricane, the high pressure also contributes to its strong winds. Wind speed is caused by a change in pressure. If the Bermuda high is exceptionally high, then the pressure difference between that and the hurricane is much larger, which leads to stronger winds. This stark contrast and enormous pressure gradient is what makes Irma's winds so strong. Angela Fritz contributed to this story."}

The 16 deadliest storms of the last century Leanna Garfield Sep. 12, 2017, 3:24 PM The devastation from Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, 2005 vs 2015. Now, residents across the Caribbean and Florida are starting to assess the devastation from the storm. One of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded, Irma led to the deaths of at least 41 people. That number is expected to rise. Hurricanes can be so deadly because they often bring uncontrollable winds and flooding. At one point, wind gusts reached 216 mph, fast enough to flip over trains, rip roofs off houses, shatter windows, and suck the ocean away from shorelines. With the invention of the electric telegraph (which made weather forecasting possible), the US National Weather Service started tracking global weather data in the mid-19th century, and established a formal hurricane warning system in 1889. According to the 2017 federal climate change report, t he scale and frequency of extreme weather events has increased over the last four decades. Here's a look at some of the deadliest storms around the world in the past century. Note: The following climate disasters include tropical cyclones, typhoons, and hurricanes, since meteorological classifications differ depending on the location and strength. The death toll counts are also estimations. For many large-scale disasters, it's nearly impossible to know exactly how many remain uncounted or unidentified. There's also still no widespread agreement on how to count victims if storm-related deaths occur months or years after it has passed. AP In 1997, a tropical wave that moved off the African coast into the tropical Atlantic ocean spawned Hurricane Pauline. Between 230 and 500 fatalities were confirmed, making it one of the deadliest Pacific hurricanes to make landfall in Mexico. It made landfall with sustained winds of 115 mph, destroying thousands of homes. Approximately 134 people went missing as well. Wikipedia Commons At the time, the 1990 Andhra Pradesh cyclone was the worst weather disaster to affect Southern India in over a decade. Severe flooding contributed to the deaths of nearly 1,000 people, while some 2.6 million were affected in other ways, including injuries, power outages, lack of access to food or water, or home damage. At its peak, it was a Category 4 storm. The eighth hurricane of the 1976 Pacific hurricane season, Liza brought severe flooding. It killed approximately 1,263 people, and left 20,000 more homeless. It ravaged northern Mexico with wind speeds up to 150 mph. The hurricane dumped heavy rains along its path, which contributed to huge mudslide that claimed approximately 800 victims. Around 1,800 people died in total from the storm. Getty Images One of the costliest weather disasters to happen in the US, Hurricane Katrina devastated areas near the Gulf of Mexico, most notably Haiti and New Orleans, in 2005. A Category 5 storm at its peak, Katrina was responsible for at least 1,833 deaths, the majority caused by wind, storm surge, and the failure of levees. AP Typhoon Haiyan tore across central Philippines, and destroyed more than a million homes in the country's low-lying coastal farming and fishing communities in 2013. The storm killed over 6,000 people. At the time, it was the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean. The storm triggered a giant tidal wave, which wiped out entire villages. Many died from starvation and water-borne diseases in the weeks after the cyclone, if rescue workers did not reach them quickly enough. In Honduras, the slow-moving hurricane dumped up to 4 inches of rain per hour for two days, causing mudslides and mass flooding. Over 11,000 people died from the disaster, and thousands more went missing. One of the strongest cyclones ever recorded in the Northern Indian Ocean, it killed approximately 11,520 people in Pakistan. The cyclone hit a southeast state in the country. Heavy storm surges and winds (up to 155 mph in some areas) contributed to the deaths of at least 14,204 people. AP One of the deadliest tropical cyclones on record, Cyclone Nargis hit India, Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Laos, Yangon, and the Ayeyarwady Region in 2008. Packing winds upward of 120 miles an hour, the storm triggered extreme flooding that contributed to the death of over 138,000 people. Up to 150 mph winds led to a 20-foot surge of floodwater across the region, completely overwhelming some islands. YouTube Typhoon Nina brought severe flooding to the Philippines, causing the Banqiao Dam and a series of smaller nearby dams to collapse in 1975. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that 229,000 people died in the disaster. It reached its peak with winds of 115 mph. Between 300,000 and 500,000 people, including approximately 100,000 fishermen, died in the aftermath of the cyclone. Most deaths were attributed to a large storm surge that overwhelmed the islands and tidal flats, wiped out villages, and destroyed crops near the Bay of Bengal. All rights reserved.

Some three million people on the U.S. southeast coast faced an urgent evacuation order Thursday as Hurricane Matthew bore down on Florida. Matthew hit them as a Category Four hurricane but has since been downgraded to three, on a scale of five, by the US National Hurricane Center. The first evacuations were ordered in the United States as coastal residents prepared to escape the approaching monster storm, expected off the East Coast later this week.

Hurricane Matthew roared into the southwestern coast of the island of Hispaniola with devastating storm conditions as it headed north toward Cuba and the eastern coast of Florida. As the Category 4 hurricane creeps closer, Cuba, in the likely path of destruction, ordered the evacuation of more than 250,000 people from the east of the island. Hurricane Matthew took aim at densely populated Haiti and Jamaica on Monday, packing winds that could sweep away flimsy buildings and bringing torrential rain that could trigger deadly landslides and floods.

More than 100,000 customers were without power in Georgia and over 80,000 in South Carolina. Over the next two days, Irma is expected to push to the northwest, into Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee. People in the heavily populated Tampa-St. Petersburg area were braced for its first direct hit from a major hurricane since 1921. But by the time it struck in the middle of the night Monday, its winds were down to 100 mph (161 kph) or less. Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn said the situation was not as bad as it could have been but warned residents that dangerous storm surge continued. In Redington Shores west of Tampa, Carl Roberts spent a sleepless night riding out Irma in his 17th-floor beachfront condo. After losing power late Sunday, he made it through the worst of the storm shaken but unhurt. A deputy and a paramedic, who had just escorted an elderly patient to safety, were trapped for two hours until a crew could free them. Both were unhurt.

Firefighters and National Guardsmen went door-to-door and used boats to ferry families to safety. A few miles away, a huge sinkhole opened at the edge of an apartment building, swallowing air conditioning units and bushes. Firefighters evacuated more than two dozen tenants in the pounding rain and wind. Please read our Commenting Policy first. All rights reserved. result found. results found."}

There is a hurricane watch in effect for the Caribbean island of Barbuda, where the hurricane centre says the eye of Jose will pass Saturday afternoon. A NASA satellite recently revealed that Jose will likely miss the islands of Antigua and Barbuda, though there was much fear that these areas would be be directly in its path. Max sustained winds are at 145 MPH. Moving NW at 14 MPH. Irma hit Barbuda on Wednesday, damaging 95 per cent of the buildings in the region, said Gaston Browne, the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda. More than 1,100 police, military officials and other personnel have been deployed to both islands to provide help. A hurricane warning is also in effect for Sint Maarten or St. Martin and St. Barthelemy, also known as St. Barts. Travel to and from St. Martin has been temporarily halted until the storm subsides. Interior Minister Ronald Plasterk said Saturday that Jose is forecast to track northwest of St. Martin and will likely dump a lot of rain on buildings, many of which had roofs torn off by Irma. Rutte issued a warning to looters that the troops and police will clamp down hard to end the lawlessness. Many of those already impacted by Irma fled the islands on ferries and fishing boats as Jose drew near. Despite the cleanup efforts underway in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, residents and officials are concerned that Jose could draw the recovery period out even further.

Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Service , Privacy Policy and Cookies Policy . It'll take months to fully assess the damage to the hardest-hit places, and the recovery and rebuilding process will take years. But many of the weather records set by the storm are already clear. Meteorologist Phil Klotzbach tracked Irma with a team at Colorado State University's Tropical Meteorology Project. He published the final summary of the milestones the storm hit after Irma was finally downgraded to a tropical depression Monday night. You can check out the full list on the CSU site, but here are few of the biggest records the giant storm broke: Irma sustained 185-mph winds for 37 hours, the longest any cyclone on the globe has maintained that intensity. Irma's maximum sustained wind speed of 185 mph made it the strongest storm that's ever existed in the Atlantic outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. Including those regions, it's the second strongest (after Allen, which reached 190 mph). Irma tied an unnamed 1932 Cuba hurricane for the longest lifetime as a Category 5 storm: 3.25 days. Since 1966 (when the satellite era began), Irma spent more time as a Category 5 hurricane than any other storm. It had the second-highest cyclone energy of all recorded Atlantic hurricanes, trailing only Ivan. Irma also broke the record set by Hurricane Allen in 1980 for the most Accumulated Cyclone Energy in a 24-hour period. Since 1966, there have been 18 entire hurricane seasons that didn't generate as much total energy as Irma did. All rights reserved.

Hurricanes Jose and Katia, which are Category 3 storms, are following close behind. The last time there were three active hurricanes in the Atlantic was in 2010, CNN reported.

(NOAA-NASA via AP) Hurricane Jose reached Category 3 status on Thursday, after reaching Category 1 status one day prior, according to The Weather Network. Meanwhile, Katia will likely reach Mexico late Friday or early Saturday as a Category 2 or 3 storm. The Weather Network confirms that Katia could strengthen to a Category 2 storm just before landing in Mexico on Saturday. The hurricane is about 590 miles (955 km) east of the Lesser Antilles, the NHC said in its latest advisory, adding some additional strengthening was possible during the next 24 to 36 hours. Hurricane watches have been issued for Antigua and Barbuda, where 90 per cent of structures have been destroyed by Irma. Hurricane Irma is being called one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century as it killed 14 people across the Caribbean islands before turning towards Florida.

FlightAware said airlines had already canceled 1,300 more flights scheduled for Friday. Delta Air Lines said cancellations were likely to spread to coastal Georgia and South Carolina on Saturday, the Associated Press reports. In Orlando, Walt Disney World was closing all of its theme parks in the area. Rockledge and east Viera, Fla., looked like ghost towns by noon Thursday. The construction signs and equipment that have cluttered Barnes Boulevard in Rockledge for months were almost all cleared as rain pelted the nearly empty roadway. Stores such as Publix and Walgreens remained open for only a few hours this morning, shutting their doors by noon. Along the southeast coast, many motorists jammed highways. In Broward County, as Matthew closed in, a steady stream of shelter seekers walked in to the Atlantic Technical College Arthur Ashe Jr. campus. They carried bags of groceries, cases of water, blankets and pillows. Emergency management officials counted more than 1,400 people staying in 10 shelters as of Thursday morning.

The storm has killed at least 30 people across the Caribbean. The northwestern municipalities of Isabela and Quebradillas, home to some 70,000 people, were evacuated with buses Friday because the nearby Guajataca Dam was failing after the storm hit. Friday afternoon, a failing dam prompted emergency evacuations of two towns in northwestern Puerto Rico. The operators of the dam reported that the failure was causing flash-flooding downstream, the weather service in San Juan said. Follow along below for live updates on the storm.

The bill from Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, would ease requirements for deducting individual property losses and allow people to draw on their retirement funds without penalty. The legislation also seeks to encourage people around the U.S. to donate to hurricane relief efforts by temporarily suspending limits on deductions for charitable contributions. Brady says he plans to formally introduce the bill Monday. 3:40 p.m.: Congress urged to witness Puerto Rico damage Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois is asking for a bipartisan delegation of congressional leaders to visit Puerto Rico so they can personally witness the damage caused by Hurricane Maria and better understand the island's needs. Gutierrez is making his request in a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. He says that to understand the scope of the damage and the magnitude of the recovery, members of Congress need to see it firsthand. Gutierrez says years of recession, an on-going financial crisis, and high levels of outmigration present unique challenges for the island and its government. The weather service office in San Juan says dam operators reported at 2:10 p.m. that the dam at the northern end of Lake Guajataca in the northwest corner of Puerto Rico was failing and causing flash flooding downstream.

Authorities say several rivers burst their banks in the island nation, destroying several bridges and inflicting major damage on several highways. Emergency crews are now clearing storm debris on a key highway to the eastern tip of the island and its beach resorts of Bavaro-Punta Cana. Meanwhile, some 300,000 homes are without power after Maria's winds toppled many utility poles. Also Friday, Puerto Rico was digging out from the storm. Some generators in Puerto Rico have been breaking down or running out of gas, prompting at least two hotels to evacuate hundreds of people.

The 2 a.m. advisory said hurricane conditions were expected to continue all Friday spreading in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas, and tropical storm conditions were possible in the central Bahamas from later in the day. The storm's location at 2 a.m. was about 100 miles north of the Dominican Republic, and 45 miles east southeast of Grand Turk Island. 12:39 a.m. Sept. 22: Maria taking its time approaching Turks and Caicos Hurricane Maria, still a Category 3 storm, is taking its time approaching the Turks and Caicos, the National Hurricane Center said. Dangerous high winds and torrential rains continued along the northern coast of the Dominican Republic as the storm slowly moves closer to Turks and Caicos. Maria's eye is expected to gradually move away from the northern coast of the Dominican Republic and then move near or just east of the Turks and Caicos Islands and southeastern Bahamas on Friday. Puerto Rico is still being lashed by rain, and flash flooding warnings continue. 10 p.m. Sept. 21: Trump speaks with Puerto Rico governor The White House says President Trump spoke with the governors of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire island of Puerto Rico was left without power after Maria knocked out its already weakened electrical grid.

The forecasters here are giving regular updates on Irma and taking turns giving TV interviews. The place will get busier in the next few days, and on Saturday night will go into lockdown, with metal shutters enclosing the doors and everyone in for the night until the storm passes. Irma remains on track to hit South Florida, and on Thursday, the center posted a hurricane watch for coastal Florida all the way from Jupiter Inlet in northern Palm Beach County down around the tip of the peninsula to Bonita Beach in southwest Florida just north of Naples. That includes the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee. A storm surge watch has also been posted. So even within the hurricane there are gradations of violence.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said Matthew remained a powerful Category 3 storm, with top sustained winds of 125 mph as of 5 a.m. EDT Thursday, up from 115 mph hours earlier. Matthew was briefly a very dangerous Category 5 storm on its march across the Caribbean. At least 16 deaths in the Caribbean have been blamed on the storm. U.S. military personnel in helicopters are expected to start arriving to help deliver food and water to hard-hit areas. Early Thursday, Matthew was centered about 255 miles southeast of West Palm Beach, Florida, moving northwest at 12 mph. Along the East Coast, people boarded up beach homes, some schools closed and residents began clearing out. The storm was forecast to scrape much of the Florida coast and any slight deviation could mean landfall or it heading farther out to sea.

Hundreds of thousands of Americans headed for higher ground Wednesday as Hurricane Matthew barreled toward the Florida and South Carolina coasts and the death toll from the monster storm climbed to at least 25. Evacuations were underway in Florida and South Carolina after Matthew, which hammered Haiti and strafed Cuba, began battering the Bahamas. NBC News meteorologist Sherri Pugh said the latest data from the National Hurricane Center indicated that Matthew could shift to a dangerous path immediately along the coast of Florida near Melbourne and Daytona Beach on Friday, resulting in landfall and hurricane conditions for millions along the coast. Thursday morning: Some strengthening, with the worst conditions occurring in Nassau. Thursday afternoon and evening: Matthew will be over the northern Bahamas, with some rain reaching southern Florida. Friday morning: Highest impacts near Melbourne, Fla., with hurricane conditions and possible landfall. Friday afternoon and evening: Central coastal Florida experiencing hurricane conditions through the day. Saturday morning: Depending on the position, coastal South Carolina (around Charleston) or Savannah, Ga., could have strong wind and rain. Saturday afternoon and evening: Matthew could be moving eastward, with Myrtle Beach, S.C., feeling lesser impacts. On Florida's east coast, mandatory evacuations were underway from the barrier islands in Brevard County, and many coastal residents in Duval, Volusia and Flagler counties were already starting to head inland. Drivers won't be charged tolls on major roadways leading out of the region, including all of the Florida Turnpike, officials said.

Hurricane season doesn't hit its peak until September 10 and normally, the average date of the fourth hurricane in a year is September 21. The Weather Company's most recent updated forecast predicted 17 named storms, nine hurricanes, and said four of those would be major. CSU most recently predicted 16 named storms, eight hurricanes, and said three of those would be major. Irma is making a long journey across the Atlantic that will test prediction science, according to Ventrice. A number of models have Irma headed a bit further north than the Gulf, either pointed towards the East Coast or potentially turning away. While conditions have been particularly favorable to hurricane formation recently, Ventrice said that wouldn't necessarily remain the case throughout the season. The Weather Channel predicts a dip in activity right around the theoretical peak, sometime after Irma. By that point in time, Ventrice said he expected the conditions causing storms to form off the coast of Africa could come to an end, but we could see an uptick in storms forming in the Caribbean. The climatological peak doesn't mean it'll always be the strongest time of year for storms just because it's the annual average, he said. Another measure that meteorologists use to track the force of storms we've experienced so far is accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), which takes into account the number of storms we've seen, how powerful they've been, and how long they lasted, according to Klotzbach. Since that measure usually jumps significantly after this point, Klotzbach said it's an indication of more storms ahead. All rights reserved.

Matthew was expected to bring 15 to 25 inches of rain, and up to 40 inches (100 centimeters) in isolated places, along with up to 10 feet (3 meters) of storm surge and battering waves. The storm was moving along the Windward Passage between Haiti and Jamaica, where it was dumping heavy rain that caused flooding. It was headed for southeastern Cuba and then the Bahamas.

The latest update reflects the 10 a.m. The vicious storm is next set to hit Florida's west coast hardest, with a combination of destructive winds and a devastating storm surge. Winds in excess of 100 mph could batter numerous population centers along Florida's west coast, including Naples and Fort Myers and up the coast to Tampa. And coastal waters could rise 10 to 15 feet above normally dry land, completely inundating homes, businesses, and roads. At 10 a.m. The storm, packing peak winds of 130 mph, was crawling to the north-northwest at 8 mph. and, following Hurricane Harvey's assault in Texas, marked the first time on record two Category 4 storms had made landfall in the U.S. in the same year. Sustained winds in Miami and Fort Lauderdale were 40 to 50 mph Sunday morning, gusting to 60 to 70 mph. The National Weather Service in Miami warned gusts could reach 100 mph at the upper floors of high rise buildings, and an isolated gust hit 100 mph at the University of Miami, according to The Weather Channel. Video from NBC News showed water pouring through Miami city streets, in between high rises. European model simulation of maximum winds gusts every 6 hours Sunday to Monday from Hurricane Irma. Tropical storm warnings also spread over almost all over Georgia, including Atlanta, eastern Alabama, and the southern South Carolina coast. (National Hurricane Center) A storm-surge warning was also issued for much of the Florida peninsula (except for a small section from North Miami Beach to Jupiter Inlet), and even extended up the Georgia coast into southern South Carolina. (National Weather Service) Because of the shift in the most likely storm track to the west, Miami and Southeast Florida were most likely to miss the storm's intensely destructive core, known as the eyewall, where winds are strongest. Even so, because of Irma's enormous size, the entire Florida peninsula and even the panhandle were likely to witness damaging winds. The percent chance of at least sustained tropical-storm (39 mph) force winds. (National Hurricane Center) A computer model projection showed nearly 2 million power outages were possible in Florida and the Southeast U.S. from the storm's winds. While Irma's peak winds had lessened some on Saturday, easing down to 120 miles per hour, as its center scraped over Cuba's north coast, it restrengthened over the extremely warm water of the Florida straits (nearly 90 degrees). Projected path In South Florida, conditions will continue to deteriorate Sunday as Irma chugs up the coast. The storm will cross the Florida Keys (near Marathon) on Sunday morning, before moving up the west coast Sunday afternoon and evening, battering Marco Island, Naples, Cape Coral, Fort Myers, Port Charlotte, Sarasota and Tampa. The storm track could still shift slightly west. If it shifts west, the center could stay over the Gulf of Mexico until hitting northern portion of Florida's Gulf Coast Sunday night, perhaps in the Big Bend area south of Tallahassee. Models run Saturday night suggested a landfall between Naples and Tampa on Sunday afternoon or evening was plausible, but pinpointing the exact landfall location is difficult for a storm predicted to parallel a long coastline. Group of simulations from American (blue) and European (red) computer models from Saturday night. Each color strand represents a different model simulation with slight tweaks to initial conditions. Note that the strands are clustered together where the forecast track is most confident but they diverge where the course of the storm is less certain. The Tampa Bay area hasn't had a direct hit from a hurricane since 1921, but this part of the state is home to some of the most vulnerable real estate to flooding. The current forecast track has Irma making her final landfall in between Naples and St. Petersburg. Given the current forecast, sustained tropical-storm-force winds are expected Sunday morning, with winds gradually increasing. It will sweep buildings away. Sustained tropical-force winds will continue coming in waves throughout the day as spiral bands cycle in, with hurricane-force wind gusts embedded in some of the stronger rainbands. The worst conditions will persist through much of the day Sunday, with sustained winds of 60-plus mph with gusts in excess of 75 mph. As it has been noted, Irma is an extremely large storm, with hurricane force winds extending some 90 miles from the center. As the storm begins to interact with more land, it will lose some of its peak wind speeds but actually grow in physical size. The somewhat forgotten danger with landfalling hurricanes in the extreme rainfall that can develop over inland areas. 3-day rainfall potential (National Hurricane Center) Potential effects on Georgia and the southeastern U.S. Beyond Florida, there is the likelihood for damaging winds, flooding rain and a coastal storm surge farther north. Georgia is likely to see some of the worst effects Sunday night into Monday. Irrespective of Irma's track its circulation is enormous, so it would still likely push a significant storm surge toward the Georgia and South Carolina coasts, where a storm surge warning is in effect. Tropical-storm and even hurricane-force winds are also likely to affect much of Georgia, with downed trees and power outages could be a big problem there. Strong winds could expand into southern South Carolina and eastern Alabama as Monday wears on. Heavy rains are also likely to swell north and west into Alabama, Tennessee and western North Carolina Monday into Tuesday. Irma's path so far Just after 9 p.m. Friday, Irma made landfall on the north coast of Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph. It became that country's first Category 5 hurricane since 1924. Fueled by the extremely warm ocean temperatures, Irma reintensified to the maximum hurricane classification level after weakening slightly on Friday afternoon. As it scraped Cuba's north coast early Saturday, it produced a sustained wind gust of 118 mph, and a gust to 159 mph reported at Falla, Cuba in the eyewall of hurricane. Via NASA On Friday, before making landfall along Cuba's north-central coast, Irma passed north of Haiti and then between Cuba's northeast coast and the Central Bahamas. Thursday evening, the center of the storm passed very close to the Turks and Caicos, producing potentially catastrophic Category 5 winds. The storm surge was of particular concern, as the water had the potential to rise 16 to 20 feet above normally dry land in coastal sections north of the storm center, causing extreme inundation. Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the hurricane passed directly over Barbuda and St. Martin in the northern Leeward Islands, the strongest hurricane ever recorded in that region and tied with the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane as the strongest Atlantic storm to strike land. As Barbuda took a direct hit, the weather station there clocked a wind gust to 155 mph before it went offline. The storm also passed directly over Anguilla and St. Martin early Wednesday, causing severe damage. Among the most intense storms on record, it trails only Hurricane Allen in 1980, which had winds of 190 mph. It is tied for second-most intense with Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane. The storm maintained maximum wind speeds of at least 180 mph for 37 hours, longer than any storm on Earth on record, passing Super Typhoon Haiyan, the previous record-holder (24 hours). Late Tuesday, its pressure dropped to 914 millibars (the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm), ranking as the lowest of any storm on record outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the Atlantic basin. Irma's landfall pressure of 929 millibars in the Florida Keys was the lowest for any U.S. landfalling hurricane since Katrina (920 millibars) and for a Fla. landfall since Andrew (922 millibars). It ranks as the 7th lowest pressure of any U.S. landfalling storm. Capital Weather Gang hurricane expert Brian McNoldy contributed to this report.

Tribune news servicesContact Reporter Hurricane Matthew churned toward the Bahamas early Wednesday with a spreading mix of high winds, heavy rains and a dangerous storm surge, leaving widespread damage and human suffering behind in Haiti's poor, rural southwestern peninsula. At least 11 deaths had been blamed on the powerful storm during its weeklong march across the Caribbean, five of them in Haiti. But with a key bridge washed out, roads impassable and phone communications down, the western tip of Haiti was isolated and there was no word on dead and injured. Forecasters said the high winds, pounding rains and storm surge were already beginning to have an impact in the southern Bahamas as the powerful Category 3 hurricane left Haiti and eastern Cuba behind and marched toward the island chain over open waters Wednesday. A day earlier, Matthew swept across a remote area of Haiti with 145 mph winds, and government leaders said they weren't close to fully gauging the impact in the vulnerable, flood-prone country where less powerful storms have killed thousands. The hurricane also had made landfall Tuesday night near Cuba's sparsely populated eastern tip with no immediate reports of major damage. By Wednesday it was moving again over open waters on a forecast path expected to take it very near Florida's Atlantic coast by Thursday evening. At 5 a.m. EDT Matthew's eye was about 65 miles north-northwest of the tip of eastern Cuba.

Bahamas Prime Minister Perry Christie voiced concern about the potential impact on the sprawling archipelago off Florida's east coast. The hurricane center said winds had slightly decreased overnight as Matthew dropped from a Category 4 to a still powerful Category 3 storm early Wednesday. But forecasters warned such fluctuations in intensity were expected and that Matthew would remain a powerful and dangerous storm over coming days. There was growing concern on the U.S. East Coast, which was expected to come under threat after Matthew made a two-day surge up the length of the Bahamas.

In Haiti, where international aid efforts were stymied Tuesday because of the lack of access to the hardest-hit areas, many residents of flooded areas seen by Associated Press reporters were wading through shin-high waters. Muddy rivers and tributaries continued to rise as water flowed down hillsides and mountains, making more flash floods and mudslides possible even Matthew tracked away from the country. Matthew was at one point a Category 5 storm, making it the most powerful hurricane in the region in nearly a decade. It blew ashore around dawn Tuesday in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and a place where many people live in shacks of wood or concrete blocks. Mourad Wahba, U.N. secretary-general's deputy special representative for Haiti, said at least 10,000 people were in shelters and hospitals were overflowing and running short of water. Surging waters ripped away a bridge in the flooded town of Petit Goave, preventing any road travel to the hard-hit southwest. Local radio reported water shoulder high in parts of the southern city of Les Cayes. Milriste Nelson, a 65-year-old farmer in the town of Leogane, said neighbors fled when the wind tore away the corrugated metal roof on their home. His own small yard was strewn with the fruit he depends on for his livelihood. Haitian authorities had tried to evacuate people from the most vulnerable areas ahead of the storm, but many were reluctant to leave their homes. Some sought shelter only after the worst was already upon them. Rainfall totals were predicted to reach 15 to 25 inches in Haiti, with up to 40 inches in isolated places. OFFICIALS WORRIED ABOUT COMPLACENCY Hurricane Matthew's slog toward the East Coast has government officials worried about complacency, especially in South Florida, which hasn't seen a major hurricane in 11 years. South Carolina's governor said she would issue an evacuation order Wednesday so that 1 million people would have time to leave the coast, and residents up and down the Eastern seaboard flocked to hardware stores, grocery aisles and gas stations to prepare for the powerful storm. A dangerous Category 3 storm with sustained winds of 125 mph, Matthew was bearing down on the southern Bahamas early Wednesday amid forecasters' predictions it would be very near Florida's Atlantic coast by Thursday evening. Already the hurricane was spreading high winds, heavy rain and a dangerous storm surge ahead of it on its approach to the Bahamas, forecasters said. It added that while maximum winds decreased slightly in recent hours, the fluctuation in intensity was expected and some slight strengthening is forecast in coming days. Officials hope to avoid a repeat of Hurricanes Wilma and Katrina, which caused major damage to South Florida in 2005, and Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm, leveled much of the city of Homestead in 1992. Curbelo, a Republican, said he wants assurances that the federal, state and local governments are working together. The Miami forecasters issued a hurricane warning for the area north of Golden Beach near Fort Lauderdale to Sebastian Inlet, meaning hurricane force winds of 74 mph or higher are expected within two days. A hurricane watch is also in effect from Sebastian Inlet to Fernandina Beach, meaning hurricane force winds could occur. During rush hour Tuesday, long lines formed at gas stations in Charleston, South Carolina, snarling traffic as lines snaked out of gas stations and into travel lanes. At one gas station in Mount Pleasant, the line reached about a quarter mile down the street. In South Florida, lines at grocery stores were heavier than usual and some essentials were in short supply. When Simone Corrado and her husband tried to buy water at their Publix in Davie near Fort Lauderdale, they mostly found empty shelves. There were a few bottles of high-end water brands, but there was so much empty shelf space that Corrado lay down and fully stretched out on the bottom shelf. Florida Gov. Rick Scott warned residents they must be prepared to take a direct hit and evacuation orders could be issued as early as Tuesday. Hurricane Hermine became the first to strike Florida since Wilma in 2005 when it hit the eastern Panhandle on Sept. 2 as a Category 1 storm, causing one death, storm surge damage to beachfront homes and downed trees and powerlines. That 11-year lull between storms hitting Florida was the longest on record. The last storm to hit Florida from the Atlantic side was Katrina, which struck on its way to devastating the Gulf coast. It concluded a two-year span when a record eight hurricanes hit the state. Governors in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina declared states of emergency, and the White House said President Barack Obama canceled a campaign and health care events in Florida on Wednesday and would instead visit the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for an update. Some airlines let passengers change travel plans without penalty if their trip might be affected by Matthew. Near Fort Lauderdale, The Home Depot in Davie briefly ran out of propane for gas barbecues and the supply of batteries was dwindling. People bought plywood to cover windows, tarps to put over outdoor furniture and coolers for food storage. Anesthesiologist Darby Lipka lugged a 20-pound propane tank across the parking lot, saying he had already purchased food and water. Haley said state officials would reverse lanes on major evacuation routes in South Carolina. It would be the first major evacuation since Hurricane Floyd in 1999, when the governor at the time didn't reverse the lanes and Interstate 26 became a parking lot.

In mountainous areas, especially Hispaniola and Cuba, flash flooding will be a much higher risk due to the water being funneled into valleys. There will also be a high risk for mudslides and road washouts. Weather conditions will improve on Friday for Hispaniola, and on Saturday for the Turks and Caicos and southern Bahamas as Irma pulls away. Dangerous weather conditions will begin to lessen on Sunday in Cuba, and on Monday for the northern and central Bahamas. Behind Irma, Hurricane Jose is churning about 800 miles east of the Lesser Antilles. Jose is expected to track to the west through the weekend and will eventually take a turn to the northwest. If Jose makes a close pass to the Leeward Islands, gusty winds and rain could impact islands that were battered by Irma. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes."}

The governor described overturned mobile homes, washed-ashore boats and rampant flood damage. In a parting blow to the state before pushing on to Georgia and beyond, the storm caused record flooding in and around Jacksonville, causing untold damage and prompting dozens of rescues. It also spread misery into Georgia and South Carolina as it moved inland with winds at 580 kph, causing flooding and power outages. Six deaths in Florida have been blamed on Irma, along with three in Georgia and one in South Carolina. At least 35 people were killed in the Caribbean.

And the governor said damage on the southwest coast, including in Naples and Fort Myers, was not as bad as feared. He said the Navy dispatched the USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln to help with relief efforts. The Keys are linked by 42 bridges that have to be checked for safety before motorists can be allowed in, officials said. The governor said the route also needs to be cleared of debris and sand, but should be usable fairly quickly. In the Jacksonville area, close to the Georgia line, storm surge brought some of the worst flooding ever seen there, with at least 46 people pulled from swamped homes. A tornado spun off by Irma was reported on the Georgia coast, and firefighters inland had to rescue several people after trees fell on their homes.

The storm is one of three hurricanes in the Atlantic basin, the first time since 2010 that three active hurricanes have been in the Atlantic, according to CNN Weather. Search and rescue crew members clears a fallen tree over a road during a search mission as hurricane Irma hits Puerto Rico in Fajardo on September 6,2017. Its maximum sustained winds of 185 mph were well above the 157 mph threshold of a Category 5 storm. Irma's powerful center will pass just north of Puerto Rico -- a US territory of about 3.4 million people -- on Wednesday evening, bringing heavy rain and dangerous coastal storm surges, forecasters said. CNN's Leyla Santiago, in the Puerto Rican capital of San Juan, said there were already power outages as strong winds lashed the island and the center of the storm moved just off the northeast coast. On Tortola, the largest of the British Virgin Islands, Kennedy Banda said fierce winds blew out the windows of his home. He and his family were taking shelter in a bathroom; he said he was bracing his body against the door in an attempt to keep it shut. A picture taken on September 5, 2017 shows a view of the Baie Nettle beach in Marigot, with the wind blowing ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Irma. Earlier, he posted video on Facebook showing wind and pounding rain whipping the shoreline as Irma's core approached. Early reports suggested damage on parts of the smaller islands, a tropical region popular with tourists. It's likely that all other older buildings there have at least been damaged, he said. Roughly 10 of these smaller islands -- such as St. Martin, Antigua and Barbuda, and St. Kitts and Nevis -- were pounded by hurricane conditions. One, Guadeloupe, has about 405,000 residents. The rest have about 264,400 people combined. Latest developments -- At least two people died and two others were seriously injured in the islands of St. Barts and St. Martin, French Overseas Affairs Minister Annick Girardin said. -- At 5 p.m. ET, Irma's core was spinning about 20 miles east of St. Thomas, with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph. -- Meanwhile, Jose, in the open Atlantic far to the southeast of Irma, became a hurricane. Katia, in the Gulf of Mexico, also became a hurricane. -- In the US Virgin Islands, Gov. Kenneth E. Mapp ordered a 36-hour curfew. -- On Thursday, Irma is likely to be near the Dominican Republic's and Haiti's northern coasts. That night, it is expected to be near the Turks and Caicos islands and the southeastern Bahamas, where storm surges of up to 20 feet are possible, the hurricane center said. -- It's too early to tell whether it will make landfall on the US mainland. Computer models show it could churn near Florida's east coast by late Sunday, and forecasters warn the core still could hit the Florida peninsula. -- In Broward County, Florida, a mandatory evacuation will go into effect at noon Thursday for areas east of Federal Highway, Mayor Barbara Sharief said. The evacuation zone includes low-lying areas and mobile homes in the county, which includes Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, and Pompano Beach and Deerfield Beach. -- Floridians should heed any evacuation order, Gov. Rick Scott said. 'We've been hiding in the bathroom' A street is flooded during the passing of Hurricane Irma on September 6, 2017 in Fajardo, Puerto Rico. Though Irma's path is uncertain, forecasters have said it could turn toward Florida over the weekend, and officials there are ordering some evacuations and shutting down schools. Irma affected many northern Caribbean islands, even those not touched by the powerful core. In Marigot, Guadeloupe, Florida resident Loren Ann Mayo rode out the storm on the sixth floor of a beachside hotel. About an inch of water covered parts of the floor, and pieces of drywall had fallen onto a balcony and a bed inside, she said. Mayo was there on a business trip. Puerto Rico: Irma's rains begin Storm surge is a concern for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Central Bahamas (up to 20 feet), as is heavy rain (up to 20 inches in the Virgin Islands, and up to 20 in parts of Puerto Rico). Puerto Ricans bracing for the high-octane winds and slashing rainfall started to feel Irma's effects Wednesday afternoon. Strong breezes shook rickety rooftops and downpours battered the coast. CNN journalists driving in San Juan didn't see any other cars, other than a few police vehicles. Residents prepped their homes for safety and gathered food supplies and belongings. Lines snaked around stores as people purchased water, food, plywood, batteries and power generators. Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas Hurricane Irma is seen in an image provided by NASA on Sept. 5, 2017. Forecasters warn that Irma's likely path will be near the Turks and Caicos on Thursday and the southeastern Bahamas on Friday -- and that the destruction could be devastating. In the Bahamas, emergency evacuations have been ordered for six southern islands -- Mayaguana, Inagua, Crooked Island, Acklins, Long Cay and Ragged Island. Storm surges there may be 20 feet. Florida: Evacuations and a rush for supplies Many Floridians spent Wednesday stocking up on food or making plans to head inland, and in some cases were leaving gas stations out of fuel and stores without needed supplies. Katherine Pina said four stores she visited in Fort Lauderdale were out of bottled water. Workers at five gas stations in Miami Beach told CNN by phone Wednesday that all were out of fuel. One said the station expected to receive more Wednesday night; another said a resupply was coming Thursday morning. Some South Florida communities ordered evacuations. Monroe County, which includes the Florida Keys, ordered visitors to head home Wednesday, with residents told to leave later in the evening. In Broward County, which includes Fort Lauderdale and other cities north of Miami, a mandatory evacuation will go into effect at noon Thursday for areas east of Federal Highway, Mayor Barbara Sharief said.

The storm is expected to remain at hurricane intensity in the Western Atlantic, and it could strengthen as it takes an odd, looping path that may bring it near the Bahamas and the United States this weekend. However, most computer models indicate Jose will stay out to sea and complete a tight enough loop to avoid moving onshore. Jose's impact is sure to be felt along the Southeast coast, bringing rough seas. Such a path is concerning in the wake of Hurricane Irma, which has altered the beach landscape and made it more vulnerable to coastal erosion and flooding. Jose's twisting path The track for Hurricane Jose is a strange one. In a pocket of weak steering winds in the open Atlantic, Jose is expected to make a clockwise loop. It will initially move farther away from the United States before coming closer to the Bahamas and East Coast. Click here to track the storm A westward motion is the result of a ridge of high pressure to the north and then east of the storm. The strength and location of this ridge will determine how far Jose moves westward before eventually turning north and then east again. Two of the most robust computer models meteorologists use to determine the odds of landfall -- GFS, the American forecast model, and the ECMWF, the European one -- keep Jose over the ocean. But models can have trouble forecasting unusual tracks such as Jose's expected path. There is generally not a dominant weather feature that is steering the storm, so model forecasts can vary widely between each other and from run to run. The center's official forecast finds Jose just over 400 miles from Jacksonville, Florida on Sunday morning. Still, the cone of uncertainty comes uncomfortably close, within 200 miles of Florida and 50 miles from the Bahamas. The storm may bring a high risk of rip currents, too. Jose already has threatened other hurricane-weary countries. As a much stronger Category 4 storm, the hurricane passed only 85 miles from the island nation of Antigua and Barbuda last weekend. Tropical storm-force winds from Jose spread over the islands on Saturday. Only three days earlier, Antigua and Barbuda had been devastated by a peak-strength Category 5 Irma, packing 185-mph winds. Hurricane season still ongoing Before this hurricane season, the United States had gone a record 12 years without a major hurricane landfall. But with Harvey and Irma, it has now experienced two Category 4 landfalls in 16 days. There have already been six named hurricanes this season: Franklin, Gert, Harvey, Irma, Jose and Katia. If history is a guide, more will be on the way. The full hurricane season lasts until November 30, although the peak season generally stretches from about mid-August to mid-October. But hurricanes into November and even December are not unheard of. Last year, Hurricane Otto formed on November 20 and made landfall in Nicaragua as a Category 2 storm.

I knew right away that even though it seemed impossible, it was absolutely legit. It happened in the Bahamas on Friday and Saturday, and now it's happening on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Sunday. On the Gulf Coast of Florida, winds were out of the east on Sunday, which pushed water west and away from the coast. In the center of the storm, where the pressure is lowest and the winds are converging, water piles up. Low pressure is basically a sucking mechanism in the sense that it draws the air inward. In any case, the missing water isn't the sign of a tsunami. The best advice is to not venture out onto the dry seabed. You don't want to be there when the water returns.

In St. Martin, 25 U.S. citizens were evacuated by a C-130 military aircraft Friday from Sonesta Great Bay Beach Resort. Resort officials said another evacuation is expected. But with the airport seriously damaged, there was no way out. They ate a lunch of sausage pizza, canned corn, applesauce and milk or juice. Mayor Mark Fisher stopped by to thank people for evacuating to the shelter. It is one of 20 set up by Broward County. Another is specifically for people with special medical needs. Infants, parents and grandparents all crammed into an at-capacity emergency shelter at the Miami-Dade County Fair and Exposition. But some locals refused to budge.

Thousands of homes have been damaged in North Carolina as a result of the storm and many are still under threat of flooding. Patricia and her husband Ron fled their home in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and sought shelter in Lumberton, only to have their car get caught in the floodwaters. Health authorities have warned that Hurricane Matthew has created conditions that are likely to cause an increase in the deadly waterborne cholera virus. Nearly a week after the storm smashed into southwestern Haiti, some communities along the southern coast have yet to receive any assistance, leaving residents who have lost their homes and virtually all of their belongings struggling to find shelter and potable water.

Hurricane Matthew passed by offshore as a Category 3 hurricane bringing heavy winds and minor flooding. Some three million people on the U.S. southeast coast faced an urgent evacuation order Thursday as Hurricane Matthew bore down on Florida. Matthew hit them as a Category Four hurricane but has since been downgraded to three, on a scale of five, by the US National Hurricane Center. The first evacuations were ordered in the United States as coastal residents prepared to escape the approaching monster storm, expected off the East Coast later this week. The dangerous Category 4 storm blew ashore around dawn in Haiti. It unloaded heavy rain as it swirled on toward a lightly populated part of Cuba and the Bahamas. Hurricane Matthew roared into the southwestern coast of the island of Hispaniola with devastating storm conditions as it headed north toward Cuba and the eastern coast of Florida. As the Category 4 hurricane creeps closer, Cuba, in the likely path of destruction, ordered the evacuation of more than 250,000 people from the east of the island. Hurricane Matthew took aim at densely populated Haiti and Jamaica on Monday, packing winds that could sweep away flimsy buildings and bringing torrential rain that could trigger deadly landslides and floods.

The Category 3 storm continues to have maximum winds of 125 mph, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The core of the storm was about 115 miles east-northeast of the southeastern Bahamas at 5 p.m. on Friday afternoon. The Turks and Caicos Islands join the southeastern and central Bahamas under tropical storm warnings. Maria was moving north-northwest at 9 mph and the storm is expected to slowly weaken while making a turn toward the north by late Saturday. Puerto Rico was still without power Friday and may have no electricity for months. The U.S. territory's governor said its death toll has risen to 13. The storm has killed at least 30 people across the Caribbean. The northwestern municipalities of Isabela and Quebradillas, home to some 70,000 people, were evacuated with buses Friday because the nearby Guajataca Dam was failing after the storm hit. Friday afternoon, a failing dam prompted emergency evacuations of two towns in northwestern Puerto Rico. The operators of the dam reported that the failure was causing flash-flooding downstream, the weather service in San Juan said. Follow along below for live updates on the storm. All times are Eastern unless otherwise noted. Max sustained winds remain at 125 MPH. The U.S. National Hurricane Center says Maria continues to have maximum sustained winds of 125 mph.

Maria is moving to the north-northwest at 9 mph and the storm is expected to slowly weaken while making a turn toward the north by late Saturday. 4:50 p.m.: Tax relief proposed for hurricane victims The head of the House's tax-writing committee is putting forward legislation to give temporary tax relief to victims of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. The bill from Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, would ease requirements for deducting individual property losses and allow people to draw on their retirement funds without penalty. The legislation also seeks to encourage people around the U.S. to donate to hurricane relief efforts by temporarily suspending limits on deductions for charitable contributions. Brady says he plans to formally introduce the bill Monday. 3:40 p.m.: Congress urged to witness Puerto Rico damage Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois is asking for a bipartisan delegation of congressional leaders to visit Puerto Rico so they can personally witness the damage caused by Hurricane Maria and better understand the island's needs. Gutierrez is making his request in a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. He says that to understand the scope of the damage and the magnitude of the recovery, members of Congress need to see it firsthand. Gutierrez says years of recession, an on-going financial crisis, and high levels of outmigration present unique challenges for the island and its government. The weather service office in San Juan says dam operators reported at 2:10 p.m. that the dam at the northern end of Lake Guajataca in the northwest corner of Puerto Rico was failing and causing flash flooding downstream. The northwestern municipalities of Isabela and Quebradillas, home to about 70,000 people, were being evacuated, the weather service said. 2:15 p.m.: Maria moves away from Turks and Caicos Islands Hurricane Maria is moving away from the Turks and Caicos Islands as a powerful Category 3 storm.

Juan Manuel Mendez, an emergency operations chief, says at least 18,500 evacuees are being kept from their homes while waiting for floodwaters to subside. Authorities say rivers overflowed and debris carried along by the floodwaters destroyed four bridges and have cut off 78 small communities on the island.

Cuomo is traveling on a donated JetBlue aircraft that officials said was the first flight to depart for San Juan since the storm. Last week Cuomo traveled to the U.S. Virgin Islands following Hurricane Irma. New York plans to send about 240 National Guardsmen and state troopers to assist Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The state is also sending drinking water, ready-to-eat meals, electrical generators and other supplies for the island territory ravaged by Hurricane Maria. 12:50 p.m.: National Guard helps U.S. Virgin Islands with recovery An Air National Guard unit from Maine is deploying to the U.S. Virgin Islands to provide critical communications to support the recovery efforts. Seven Air National Guard members from the 265th Combat Communications Squadron mobilized late Thursday.The 265th is tasked with establishing communications links for military, and if necessary, for civilian response authorities. The U.S. Virgin Islands are reeling after back-to-back hurricanes. 12:40 p.m.: Dominican Republic president tours devastated areas The president of the Dominican Republic, Danilo Medina, is touring areas hit hard by Maria. Authorities say several rivers burst their banks in the island nation, destroying several bridges and inflicting major damage on several highways. Emergency crews are now clearing storm debris on a key highway to the eastern tip of the island and its beach resorts of Bavaro-Punta Cana. Meanwhile, some 300,000 homes are without power after Maria's winds toppled many utility poles. Also Friday, Puerto Rico was digging out from the storm. Some generators in Puerto Rico have been breaking down or running out of gas, prompting at least two hotels to evacuate hundreds of people. Families also were awaiting news about when the island's airport would reopen, with many planning to fly their children to the U.S. to temporarily enroll them in schools there until life in Puerto Rico returns to normal.

The yellow areas represent tropical storm watches. National Hurricane Center 4:45 a.m.: Hurricane conditions expected all day in Turks and Caicos The eye of Hurricane Maria was heading for the Turks and Caicos Islands early Friday morning at about 7 mph, but was expected to spare that island chain and the Bahamas a direct hit. The National Hurricane Center said in its 2 a.m. But with sustained winds of 125 mph and gusts even higher, the Category 3 storm still presented a significant danger. The 2 a.m. advisory said hurricane conditions were expected to continue all Friday spreading in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas, and tropical storm conditions were possible in the central Bahamas from later in the day. The storm's location at 2 a.m. was about 100 miles north of the Dominican Republic, and 45 miles east southeast of Grand Turk Island. 12:39 a.m. Sept. 22: Maria taking its time approaching Turks and Caicos Hurricane Maria, still a Category 3 storm, is taking its time approaching the Turks and Caicos, the National Hurricane Center said. Dangerous high winds and torrential rains continued along the northern coast of the Dominican Republic as the storm slowly moves closer to Turks and Caicos. Maria's eye is expected to gradually move away from the northern coast of the Dominican Republic and then move near or just east of the Turks and Caicos Islands and southeastern Bahamas on Friday. Puerto Rico is still being lashed by rain, and flash flooding warnings continue. 10 p.m. Sept. 21: Trump speaks with Puerto Rico governor The White House says President Trump spoke with the governors of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire island of Puerto Rico was left without power after Maria knocked out its already weakened electrical grid.

Wednesday, the National Weather Service said, while on the French Caribbean islands of St. Martin and St. Barthelemy, residents were ordered to remain indoors. In San Juan, Puerto Rico, people in the Hato Rey neighborhood prepared for the storm under unusually calm, cool weather Wednesday morning that gave way to a light drizzle. People expect to lose power, which is nothing unusual for the neighborhood, where power often goes out for a few hours after a heavy rainstorm. The power, in fact, went out at about 10:15 a.m. on Wednesday. And in Miami-Dade, a county of 2.7 million, officials said they may order residents to leave coastal areas, including Miami Beach. Gas stations reported low fuel stocks and grocery stores ran out of bottled water. They belong to NextEra, a utility with about 5 million electricity customers in Florida. NextEra said that it will shut down its four nuclear reactors before Hurricane Irma arrives. That will reduce the heat in the reactors and the need for electricity. A NextEra spokesman Peter Robbins said that the nuclear plants have diesel generators located 20 feet above sea level inside reinforced concrete structures. Carolyn Boutte, 44, said she and her husband moved to a house in Key West four years ago from Gloucester, Mass., and they have never been through a hurricane threat like this. They searched for gas on Tuesday so they could escape, but the first three stations already had run out of fuel, and lines were long everywhere else. Please do not ignore evacuation orders. Hundreds of thousands of people scrambled to get out of South Florida as the storm loomed, while airlines began canceling flights and issuing fee waivers to travelers. President Trump on Tuesday evening declared an emergency in Florida as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, and Scott activated 100 members of the Florida National Guard and said he has directed all 7,000 members to report for duty on Friday. Officials across Florida responded to the dire forecasts by slowly shutting down the contours of daily life. But it was still not clear Wednesday how much of the state could be imperiled by Irma. Stocks of water and flashlights at grocery stores were wiped out, and gas was becoming scarce. Workers install hurricane shutters on the Puerto Villarta restaurant on Overseas Highway in the Florida Keys. In an effort to smooth travel, Scott on Tuesday ordered that no tolls be collected. Wilma also was the last major hurricane to make landfall in the United States until Harvey struck Texas late last month. Berman reported from Washington.

Many homes are still without power in the area. Military personnel from Barbados are helping with recovery efforts and assessing the worst-hit areas. Power was out in much of the region with extensive flooding after Hurricane Irma swept through the area. The powerful storm ripped roofs off houses, collapsed buildings and flooded hundreds of miles of coastline. Cuban officials warned residents to watch for more flooding over the next few days. There were no reports of deaths or injuries after heavy rain and winds from Irma lashed the northeastern part of the country. Seawater surged three blocks inland in Caibarien. Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) warned that all of the state's 20 million inhabitants should be prepared to evacuate as Hurricane Irma bears down for a direct hit on the state. Coastal residents around South Florida have been ordered to evacuate as the killer storm closes in on the peninsula for what could be a catastrophic blow.

The Las Olas Boulevard bridge to the Fort Lauderdale beach was blocked to allow front-end loaders to remove a thick layer of sand, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. Pompano Beach, the Broward County evacuation shelter at Pompano Beach High School started looking like the school cafeteria again Monday morning.

First one, then a half-dozen officers raced out, chased him down and arrested him, drawing the applause from many people witnessing it from inside.

As Hurricane Irma moves through the Caribbean, President Trump has issued emergency declarations for Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Puerto Rico. A major disaster declaration has also been issued for the US Virgin Islands. Amid urgent warnings from state officials to evacuate before it was too late, downtown Miami was all but abandoned on Saturday.

September 10, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus 8.09am EDT 08:09 The United Kingdom Overseas Territories Association (UKOTA) has criticised the response of the UK government - defended earlier by defence secretary Michael Fallon - to the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Irma. David Burt, UKOTA president and premier of Bermuda, said: There is an urgent need for health and social welfare support which must be met now. We welcome the commitment from the UK government in providing some immediate resources to British Nationals within the Caribbean, while questioning the adequacy of its response in other areas such as a regional reconstruction fund, and the two-week wait for the arrival of HMS Ocean. We note that the House of Commons Foreign Affairs and International Development Select Committees have raised these issues in terms as well. The overseas territories are diverse in our constitutions, populations and economic sustainability, encompassing the Caribbean, Europe, and most remote islands in the South Atlantic. We therefore call upon the UK government not only to commit immediate resources but also to examine and develop the long term economic self-sustainability of the overseas territories. September 10, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus 7.53am EDT 07:53 The warning from the National Weather Service Key West spells out the situation for people in the Florida Keys in stark terms: If you are here, please go to interior room away from windows. Treat these imminent extreme winds as if a tornado was approaching and move immediately to the safe room in your shelter. Take action now to protect your life. You should already be taking cover. EYE IS 15 MILES SOUTHEAST OF KEY WEST. We are still receiving and going to be receiving hurricane force winds and of course we are very concerned about the tidal surges."}

Two big factors will govern the ultimate path Irma takes. This system, around which winds flow clockwise, acts as a guardrail to Irma, shunting it farther south and west like a pinball, and preventing it from heading out to sea. The stronger the ridge, the greater the probability that its westward movement will continue. We are in the home stretch. Frustrating for FLA yet this is just how the slowing & turning cyclones go. No easy early answer of precision. This is a zone of low pressure spinning away over the southern Tennessee Valley within a dip in the jet stream, that spins counterclockwise. This will eventually capture Irma into its overall circulation, but the strength and forward speed of that feature will determine Irma's propensity to move inland. Based on how these two important weather features evolve and interact with Irma, four scenarios seem plausible, the first three of which seem about equally likely: Scenario 1: An extremely close shave, but no Florida landfall (possible) GFS model simulation showing Irma just off the east coast of Florida at 8 a.m. Sunday. Since Wednesday morning, a number of model simulations have forecast Hurricane Irma making a right turn before Florida and riding northward, tracking just offshore of the Sunshine State. In this scenario, Miami would be spared the dangerous right-hand side of the storm. Hurricanes are most dangerous to the right of their center, since their rotating winds couple with the storm's forward motion, making the gusts inside that much stronger. This would occur in the Saturday-Sunday time frame. The Florida Keys would see less in the way of impacts, contrary to the dire circumstances portrayed by a consensus of model depictions on Tuesday. However, a storm surge or rise in water above normally dry land of 4 to 8 feet would still be likely along the immediate shores of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, thanks to northerly winds stemming from the storm's counterclockwise circulation. Think of a hurricane like a spinning top; because the top rotates so quickly, it may jog left or right a little bit as it treks along while rotating furiously. Irma is the same way. This would buffet seaside communities with rain and wind, but it would be akin to a strong tropical storm or low-end hurricane, and keep the bulk of any major concerns offshore. There's yet another ingredient complicating this forecast: the presence of Hurricane Jose east of the Leeward Islands. Potential interaction with the newly-formed hurricane, in an elegant dance known as the Fujiwhara Effect, could affect Irma's path. This occurs when hurricanes in proximity orbit one another about a common center, but it depends on how close of an approach Jose makes. Right now, it's looking like the two won't begin to orbit one another until Sunday or Monday, but that could help slow down Irma's motion. If that were to occur, it could be more easily snagged by the wave of low pressure over Southeast, slingshotted northward. This would put the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina in extreme jeopardy. Clearly, there are a lot of moving parts that could alter this first scenario. In this scenario, the system may make landfall in southern Florida as a major hurricane of at least Category 4 strength. No words. A catastrophic storm surge would sweep ashore, while devastating inland flooding would result from excessive rainfall. Scenario 3: Riding up the spine of Florida; landfall closer to the Keys (possible) European model simulation showing Irma on the southern tip of Florida at 8 a.m. Some models are hinting that Irma may wait longer to turn north, which would spell big problems for the southern peninsula, the Keys, and areas south of Okeechobee. In this scenario, Irma would move ashore somewhere between the Keys and Miami. All of Florida would see wind and rain, but the heaviest would be relegated to areas south of Route 75, including the Everglades, Homestead and Key Biscayne. The worst conditions would sweep ashore to the right side of the eye, exposing the Miami metro area to extreme hurricane-force winds, a surge of at least several feet, and torrential downpours. Locations left of the center on Florida's west coast would experience Irma's weaker side but would still be exposed to strong tropical storm or weak hurricane conditions. The most destructive winds and devastating storm surge would occur in southwest Florida, assuming that's where the center first comes ashore. It's not out of the question models could shift west in this direction. The bottom line It will be at least another one or two days before we are fully able to iron out the details of the forecast over Florida, and longer for the Carolinas and the U.S. southeastern coast. Errors in the track forecast are as wide as the Florida peninsula at this juncture. Interests in any of the potentially affected areas should keep an eye to the latest forecasts and prepare, as Irma is a force to be reckoned with."}

Some three million people on the U.S. southeast coast faced an urgent evacuation order Thursday as Hurricane Matthew bore down on Florida. Matthew hit them as a Category Four hurricane but has since been downgraded to three, on a scale of five, by the US National Hurricane Center. The first evacuations were ordered in the United States as coastal residents prepared to escape the approaching monster storm, expected off the East Coast later this week. The dangerous Category 4 storm blew ashore around dawn in Haiti. It unloaded heavy rain as it swirled on toward a lightly populated part of Cuba and the Bahamas. Hurricane Matthew roared into the southwestern coast of the island of Hispaniola with devastating storm conditions as it headed north toward Cuba and the eastern coast of Florida. As the Category 4 hurricane creeps closer, Cuba, in the likely path of destruction, ordered the evacuation of more than 250,000 people from the east of the island. Hurricane Matthew took aim at densely populated Haiti and Jamaica on Monday, packing winds that could sweep away flimsy buildings and bringing torrential rain that could trigger deadly landslides and floods.

You know they happen theoretically, but the chances of seeing the most extraordinary weather phenomena are slim to none. The wind on Long Island in the Bahamas is from the southeast to the northwest on Saturday. On the northwest side of the island, it would be blowing the water away from the shoreline. In the center of the storm, where there is extreme low pressure, water is drawn upward. As the storm draws water toward the center, it gets pulled away from the surroundings. In any case, this isn't the sign of a tsunami. The water will return to Long Island, and it probably won't rush back with any great force. It will probably be back by Sunday afternoon.

The storm was crawling to the north-northwest at just eight mph at the time, but the winds were blowing at close to 130 mph. Just prior to landfall, the Marco Island Police Department reported a 130-mph wind gust in the eyewall of the hurricane. The city of Naples experienced a 142-mph gust. Winds are gusting to 90 mph at Miami International Airport. Irma is moving into the Southeast U.S., bringing torrential rain with it. The storm made its first Florida landfall in the Keys on Sunday morning. More than half of all hurricane deaths are caused by storm surge. Power outages are likely, even away from the coast. It cannot be understated how dangerous these winds will be. All inland locations that receive rain from Hurricane Irma or its remnants should be prepared for flash flooding.

Irma, meanwhile, continued to push west, making landfall in Cuba around 11 p.m. Eastern Friday and gaining strength on its march toward the Bahamas and, eventually, Florida. The Cuban government moved hundreds of thousands of people away from cities and towns along the coast in preparation for Irma, including some 36,000 tourists from hotels and beach resorts that are likely to be pounded. State media showed images Friday of soldiers and Cuban civil defense brigades moving residents into shelters. Children and elderly residents could be seen in them, eating sandwiches and snacks in the near-darkness.

Click here to track Franklin NOAA's upgraded outlook agrees with last week's update from Colorado State University. CSU predicts 16 named storms -- including the five that have already occurred -- with eight becoming hurricanes and three reaching major hurricane status (winds above 111 mph). Tropical Storm Arlene formed briefly in April in the north-central Atlantic. An extremely rare occurrence, Arlene was just the second named storm on record for the month of April. Since then the season has remained above average with respect to the number of storms, with six named storms by August 6. On average, the sixth named storm does not occur for another month, around September 8. Even though the calendar says we are over one-third of the way through the hurricane season, we are just getting into its busiest part. As if on cue, the tropical Atlantic has been heating up this week, with Franklin churning in the southern Gulf of Mexico and another area of potential development farther out in the ocean. Franklin has already prompted hurricane warnings for parts of Mexico's east coast as the system will move into the Mexican state of Veracruz late Wednesday into early Thursday. Several hundred miles to the east, a disorganized cluster of storms bears watching as it moves towards near the Lesser Antilles. It is still too early to say for sure if the system, which would be named Gert if it develops, would curve back out to sea before reaching the US coast. One of its effects is increased wind shear across the tropical Atlantic, which creates hostile conditions for tropical storm development. Amazingly, the US has not experienced landfall of a major hurricane -- a Category 3 or higher, with sustained winds of 111 mpg and higher -- since Hurricane Wilma in 2005. That streak nearly ended last year with Hurricane Matthew. After several quieter seasons, 2016 was above normal, as expected, with 15 named storms, seven hurricanes and four major hurricanes. Hurricane Matthew had the greatest impact, with its center passing just offshore of eastern Florida and Georgia as a major hurricane before making landfall in South Carolina as a Category 1 storm and bringing historic flooding to North Carolina.

It has since begun lashing Puerto Rico and is also threatening havoc and destruction in the Virgin Islands, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba. The Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands will also be at risk on Thursday. The authorities warned that the toll would rise as communications improved. The storm is expected to reach Florida early on Saturday, potentially causing catastrophic flooding. A telecommunications tower was broken in two. At least one person, an infant, was killed. Video Devastation in Barbuda The prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, Gaston Browne, described how the island of Barbuda was nearly leveled by Hurricane Irma. By ABS TELEVISION ANTIGUA on Publish Date September 6, 2017. . In his initial statement Wednesday morning, Mr. Browne suggested he had been receiving reports from Barbuda. But he later clarified that, in fact, the storm had knocked out all official communication systems on the island, rendering officials there unreachable after the storm. As a result, it was not until the afternoon, when the prime minister surveyed Barbuda from the air, that the extent of the devastation became clear. Mr. Browne said he had been caught off guard by the utter destruction in Barbuda because it is so close to the comparatively unscathed Antigua. The islands are less than 40 miles apart. Photo Hurricane Irma hit San Juan, P.R., on Wednesday. Javorn Micheal Fahie, a taxi driver in Tortola, in the British Virgin Islands, said most of the galvanized steel roofs in his neighborhood had blown off. He saw two of them, from houses facing his, flying away in the wind. Late on Wednesday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency tweeted a photo from a resident of St. Thomas, in the United States Virgin Islands. Photo The sea rose in Fajardo, P.R., on Tuesday. With the storm expected to pass just north of San Juan between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., the governor had cautioned people to take shelter by noon in homes or in one of 156 government-run facilities. He warned that the authorities would suspend rescues once winds reached 50 m.p.h. Carmen Caballero, 69, hastily packed supplies and rushed to the nearest government shelter in San Juan around 3 p.m., after the power went out in her home and branches began to fall. Nearly 30 years ago, Puerto Rico was hit hard by Hurricane Hugo, which left more than 28,000 residents homeless. But Abigail Acevedo, 60, who survived Hugo, said Irma was worse. The Puerto Rico electric company said nearly 300,000 people had lost power by early Wednesday afternoon. More than 4,000 had lost water service, mostly because of power failures. The governor has asked the Defense Department to activate the Army National Guard for recovery efforts once the storm passes. The hurricane could hardly have come at a worse time for the territory, which is in the throes of an economic crisis and does not have money for rebuilding. It is unclear whether that property was damaged. OPEN Map The situation on St. Martin was similar: There was no power, the fire station was flooded, and the police station no longer had a roof. An officer who answered the phone at the Royal Anguilla Police Force headquarters said that one person had died in the territory. Alex Woolfall, a British public relations consultant, was staying at The Westin St. Maarten resort in St. Martin when the storm made landfall early Wednesday. Mr. Woolfall tweeted updates during the storm before the power eventually went out. Scary stuff but still have power. Noise of wind insane. This is like a movie I never want to see. Earnel Brown, who owns a small hotel in Pirates Well on the island of Mayaguana, is one of them. In Miami-Dade County, memories of the damage caused in 1992 by Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm, spurred residents to prepare for Hurricane Irma earlier than usual. Most projections have Irma slamming into the state by Sunday, although it is unclear where it might make landfall. My team, which has done, and is doing, such a good job in Texas, is already in Florida. Gov. Rick Scott activated the state National Guard and declared a state of emergency across Florida. At a news conference, he urged residents to heed evacuation advisories and to act while the storm is still days away. Irma, he said, is more powerful and dangerous than Andrew. This storm has the potential to devastate the state. The governor said 1,000 National Guard troops would be on duty by Wednesday night, and ordered most state government offices closed on Friday. He urged people to stock up on basics and refill their prescriptions, and said the state was working to address shortages of fuel and bottled water.

Thousands of homes have been damaged in North Carolina as a result of the storm and many are still under threat of flooding. Patricia and her husband Ron fled their home in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and sought shelter in Lumberton, only to have their car get caught in the floodwaters. Health authorities have warned that Hurricane Matthew has created conditions that are likely to cause an increase in the deadly waterborne cholera virus. Nearly a week after the storm smashed into southwestern Haiti, some communities along the southern coast have yet to receive any assistance, leaving residents who have lost their homes and virtually all of their belongings struggling to find shelter and potable water.

Hurricane Matthew passed by offshore as a Category 3 hurricane bringing heavy winds and minor flooding. Some three million people on the U.S. southeast coast faced an urgent evacuation order Thursday as Hurricane Matthew bore down on Florida. Matthew hit them as a Category Four hurricane but has since been downgraded to three, on a scale of five, by the US National Hurricane Center. The first evacuations were ordered in the United States as coastal residents prepared to escape the approaching monster storm, expected off the East Coast later this week. The dangerous Category 4 storm blew ashore around dawn in Haiti. It unloaded heavy rain as it swirled on toward a lightly populated part of Cuba and the Bahamas. Hurricane Matthew roared into the southwestern coast of the island of Hispaniola with devastating storm conditions as it headed north toward Cuba and the eastern coast of Florida. As the Category 4 hurricane creeps closer, Cuba, in the likely path of destruction, ordered the evacuation of more than 250,000 people from the east of the island. Hurricane Matthew took aim at densely populated Haiti and Jamaica on Monday, packing winds that could sweep away flimsy buildings and bringing torrential rain that could trigger deadly landslides and floods.

As of 2 a.m. ET, Matthew was heading northwest and maintained the earlier speed at 10 mph with top sustained winds of 115 mph, having weakend slightly since daytime. Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said Wednesday there is a 25 percent chance of the county getting hurricane force winds, but no evacuations were planned at the moment. A tropical storm warning was in effect for the Florida Keys from Seven Mile Bridge eastward. At least 25 deaths had been blamed on the powerful storm during its weeklong march across the Caribbean, 19 of them in Haiti. The mayor of Petit Goave, a coastal community west of the capital Port-au-Prince, told NBC News 14 people had died there, and the country's Civil Agency has confirmed five people dead with another missing. Two days after the hurricane rampaged across Haiti's remote southwestern peninsula with roaring winds and flooding rains, local authorities and international aid workers still lack a clear picture of the storm's destruction. Dramatic Images From Hurricane Matthew AP But the weather began calming Wednesday and a way was found around a key bridge that was washed away, allowing convoys and helicopters to start ventruing to marooned corners to assess the damage and determine how to help thousands of people who lost homes, livestock and crops. The last Category 4 storm to pound Haiti was Hurricane Flora in 1963, which killed as many as 8,000 people. UpdatedDeath Toll Rises as Haiti Digs Out From Hurricane Matthew Still, Mourad Wahba, the U.N. secretary-general's deputy special representative for Haiti, called the hurricane the biggest humanitarian crisis in Haiti since the devastating earthquake of 2010. Additionally, four people were killed because of the storm in the Dominican Republic and one each in Colombia and the Carribbean (where a boulder fell on a 16-year-old boy in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines). Tropical storm conditions began spreading over the southeastern Bahamas early Thursday, and Bahamas Prime Minister Perry Christie voiced concern about the potential impact on the sprawling archipelago off Florida's east coast. Hurricane Matthew Smashes Haiti Footage of the gale-force winds in Les Cayes, Haiti. There was growing concern on the U.S. East Coast, where nearly two million people were told to evacuate given the threat of Matthew's storm surge up the length of the Bahamas. People raced to supermarkets, gas stations and hardware stores, buying up groceries, water, plywood, tarps, batteries and propane. Gov. Scott urged coastal residents to prepare for the possibility of a direct hit and line up three days' worth of food, water and medicine. The White House said relief supplies were being moved to emergency staging areas in the Southeast. The slow-moving storm was expected to drench the coast from the Florida Keys through central Florida, bring storm surge up to 5 feet deep along the Atlantic coast and possibly spawn tornadoes. Even if Matthew doesn't come ashore, its tropical storm-force winds could reach the state. Mandatory evacuations were already underway in Brevard County, and voluntary evacuations have been activated in St. Lucie County, but Gov. Scott urged other coastal residents potentially in harm's way not to wait to be told to leave. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley ordered residents in Charleston and Beaufort counties to leave on Wednesday ahead of the hurricane. She said evacuations in Georgetown and Horry counties will come on Thursday. Several cruise ships were rerouted from their scheduled trips to the Caribbeans and Bahamas to Key West, about 40 miles south of the portion of Florida currently not under a tropical storm warning. VideoHurricane Matthew Quiets Campaign Ahead of Debate Matthew was at one point a Category 5 storm, making it the most powerful hurricane in the region in nearly a decade. It blew ashore around dawn Tuesday in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and a place where many people live in shacks of wood or concrete blocks. In Haiti, where international aid efforts were stymied Tuesday because of the lack of access to the hardest-hit areas, many residents of flooded areas seen by Associated Press reporters were wading through shin-high waters. Muddy rivers and tributaries continued to rise as water flowed down hillsides and mountains, making more flash floods and mudslides possible even as Matthew tracked away from the country.

The extent of the damage is unknown given that dozens of municipalities remained isolated and without communication after Maria hit the island Wednesday morning as a Category 4 storm with 155 mph winds, the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in over 80 years. Uprooted trees and widespread flooding blocked many highways and streets across the island of 3.4 million residents, creating a maze that forced drivers to go against traffic and past police cars that used loudspeakers to warn people they must respect a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew imposed by the governor to ensure everyone's safety.

Maria is expected to bring 20 to 30 inches of rain through Saturday to Puerto Rico, the National Hurricane Center said. Strong gusty winds are still occurring over portions of Puerto Rico, but should continue to gradually subside. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 110 mph, making it a strong Category 2 storm. The eye of Maria is moving away from Puerto Rico, heading toward the Dominican Republic and then is expected to move toward Turks and Caicos. 10 p.m.: Coastal city sees hundreds of homes destroyed in Puerto Rico Felix Delgado, mayor of the northern coastal city of Catano, told The Associated Press that 80 percent of the 454 homes in a neighborhood known as Juana Matos were destroyed.

The storm, tied for the second-strongest ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, is headed for the southeastern Bahamas and, by the weekend and early next week, Florida and the Southeast United States. It added hurricanes watches would be issued for parts of the Florida Keys and Florida Peninsula late Thursday morning. Preparations should be rushed to completion along and near its projected path, including over South Florida. At 5 a.m. Its peak winds were estimated at 180 miles per hour, a slight decrease in strength from Wednesday. The storm's heavier rain bands which had been lashing Puerto Rico into Wednesday evening had retreated to the northwest and just scattered showers lingered Thursday morning. In a bit of fortunate news, the storm's eyewall, the region with the most destructive winds, had passed to its north. With the storm heading west-northwest, hurricane warnings were in effect for the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos, Haiti and the Bahamas. A hurricane watch covered Cuba. It will produce the full gamut of hurricane hazards across the Bahamas and potentially South Florida, including a devastating storm surge, destructive winds and dangerous flash flooding. Meanwhile, two new hurricanes formed late Wednesday afternoon in the Atlantic basin: Jose in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and Katia in the southwest Gulf of Mexico (see more information down below). But enough uncertainty in the track exists that all of Florida should be on the highest alert and preparing for this hurricane. Some of the computer simulations on Wednesday tracked the storm center very near Southeast Florida Sunday morning, which would present a very dangerous situation for the Miami to Fort Lauderdale area. However, shifts in the storm track are likely. Model simulations of the center of Irma at 2 p.m. Sunday. Tropical-storm-force winds are likely to arrive in Florida on Saturday, with the worst storm conditions occurring Sunday. The most extreme conditions are likely to occur near the storm center, but it is impossible this far out to pinpoint exactly where that will track. And serious storm effects will expand well outside the center. The entire Florida peninsula is only about 100 miles wide, small compared to the size of the storm. Tropical-storm-force winds presently extend outward up to 185 miles from the storm center and hurricane-force winds extend 50 miles away. Saffir-Simpson category rating of a hurricane only refers to peak winds in eyewall. Remember, the category rating only refers to the peak winds in the eyewall, not the size of the storm, the rainfall and the storm surge. The rainfall forecast for the coming week shows a heavy swath over the Florida peninsula, and then spreading northward into the Carolinas as Irma likely tracks over those areas early next week. A flash flooding warning was also issued. The Hurricane Center provides this description of the potential damage inflicted by Category 5 winds: A high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months. As the storm passes just north of the Dominican Republic and Haiti on Thursday, hurricane-force winds and torrential rains are possible. Later on Thursday, the storm will near the Turks and Caicos and southeastern Bahamas, where it could push ashore a devastating storm surge of 15 to 20 feet above normally dry land. Irma's path through the Northern Lesser Antilles Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the hurricane passed directly over Barbuda and Saint Martin in the northern Leeward Islands, the strongest hurricane ever recorded in that region and tied with the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane as the strongest Atlantic storm to strike land. As Barbuda took a direct hit, the weather station there clocked a wind gust to 155 mph before it went offline. The storm surge on the island, or the rise in water above normally dry land, reached at least 8 feet. Widespread destruction was reported on the island. The storm also passed directly over Anguilla and St. Martin early Wednesday, causing severe damage. Among the most intense storms on record, it only trails Hurricane Allen in 1980, which had winds of 190 mph. It is tied for second most intense with Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane. The storm has maintained maximum wind speeds of at least 185 mph longer than any other storm on Earth in recorded history. Late Tuesday night, its pressure dropped to 914 millibars (the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm), ranking as the lowest of any storm on record outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the Atlantic basin. The storm has generated the most Accumulated Cyclone Energy, a measure of both a storm's duration and intensity, of any hurricane on record. Without a doubt, the World Meteorological Organization will retire the names Harvey and Irma after this season. Two Category 4 hurricanes hit in Texas and Louisiana six weeks apart that year. Credit to tropical weather expert and occasional Capital Weather Gang contributor Phil Klotzbach for some of the statistics in this section. Hurricanes Jose and Katia While Irma is grabbing all of the attention, two other hurricanes are spinning in the Atlantic basin: Tropical Storm Jose was upgraded to a hurricane late Wednesday afternoon. Positioned far out in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the storm was rapidly gaining strength and was forecast to become a major Category 3 storm by Friday. The current track forecast keeps it mostly away from land areas over the next couple of days but brings it close to the same islands in the northeastern Lesser Antilles slammed by Irma this weekend and forecasters will be watching it closely. Tropical Storm Katia, which formed early Wednesday in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, intensified quickly into a hurricane late Wednesday afternoon. It could intensify into a Category 2 hurricane before making landfall in the Mexico state of Veracruz Friday into Saturday, where a hurricane warning is in effect. And now we also have Jose and Katia adding to the tally. He earned a master's degree in atmospheric science and spent 10 years as a climate change science analyst for the U.S. government. He holds the Digital Seal of Approval from the National Weather Association. His website hosted at RSMAS is also quite popular during hurricane season."}

Hurricane Hazards While hurricanes pose the greatest threat to life and property, tropical storms and depression also can be devastating. The primary hazards from tropical cyclones (which include tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes) are storm surge flooding, inland flooding from heavy rains, destructive winds, tornadoes, and high surf and rip currents. Storm surge is the abnormal rise of water generated by a storm's winds. This hazard is historically the leading cause of hurricane related deaths in the United States. Storm surge and large battering waves can result in large loss of life and cause massive destruction along the coast. Storm surge can travel several miles inland, especially along bays, rivers, and estuaries. Flooding from heavy rains is the second leading cause of fatalities from landfalling tropical cyclones. Widespread torrential rains associated with these storms often cause flooding hundreds of miles inland. This flooding can persist for several days after a storm has dissipated. Winds from a hurricane can destroy buildings and manufactured homes. Signs, roofing material, and other items left outside can become flying missiles during hurricanes. Tornadoes can accompany landfalling tropical cyclones. These tornadoes typically occur in rain bands well away from the center of the storm. Dangerous waves produced by a tropical cyclone's strong winds can pose a significant hazard to coastal residents and mariners. These waves can cause deadly rip currents, significant beach erosion, and damage to structures along the coastline, even when the storm is more than a 1,000 miles offshore. Please Contact Us."}

Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Service , Privacy Policy and Cookies Policy . Irma alone has generated more cyclone energy than 12 entire hurricane seasons. More hurricanes should still be expected. Hurricane Irma is churning through the Caribbean, setting records for being the first storm to sustain 185 mph Category 5 winds for 37 hours. Hurricane Katia is simultaneously moving toward the Mexican coastline. And hurricane season, which peaks on September 10, is not yet even halfway over. In some ways, this season seems even more noteworthy than it is, just because we're expected two major hurricanes to make landfall in the US. The hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005 were similar in terms of destruction and landfalling hurricanes. Much of that activity showed up at the end of August, with the destruction unleashed by Hurricane Harvey's record-setting rains, and in the first days of September, with Katia, Jose, and Irma. To track the activity of hurricane season, researchers look at factors including the number of named storms in the season and the accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), a measure that takes into account the number of storms we've seen, how powerful they've been, and how long they lasted. There are normally 2.6 hurricanes by the same date, but we've had 6. That ties the 1893 record for hurricanes formed between August 7 and September 6 (though it's likely there was some undercounting before the satellite era began in 1966). By those measures, we were already having an active year, Belanger told Business Insider. But it was Irma's cyclone energy that really pushed the year from above normal to well above what would be expected at this point in time. According to Klotzbach, Irma has produced more ACE alone than 12 entire Atlantic hurricane seasons since 1966 saw. The storm broke Hurricane Allen's 1980 record for ACE generated in a 24-hour period and is already in the top 5 of the Atlantic storms that generated the most ACE throughout their existence by Friday. Ocean heat and wind shear As for what's made it such an intense year, the answer is complicated, according to Belanger. Warm water helps storms intensify. Since Irma, like Harvey before it, formed near the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of Africa, it had a long journey across the Atlantic, providing enough time for it to pick up significant heat energy and intensity. Two combined factors have an effect on these Atlantic temperatures: ocean heat content, a measure of heat stored by the ocean; and sea surface temperatures, measured at the top layer of the ocean. Irma encountered abnormally high levels of both measures. This allowed Irma to reach its maximum potential intensity, according to Belanger, bringing it to record-setting strength. Right now, Irma is still an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm with sustained winds of 150 mph and major population centers, including Miami, in its path. And between Cuba and Florida, Irma is encountering some of the warmest waters it has seen yet. Those warm temperatures have allowed Irma to expand its windfield and it could return to Category 5 strength, though it has devastating potential even if it doesn't. There's no simple answers to account for the warmer sea surface temperatures and high ocean heat content, according to Belanger. One possibility is that weaker trade winds and wind speeds in the Atlantic have led to less evaporation, which would normally cool the ocean more. Changes in high and low pressure systems over the Atlantic may also have caused surface temperatures to fluctuate, Michael Ventrice, a meteorological scientist at The Weather Company, told Business Insider last week. Plus, he said, a current called the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) may have played a role. Other scientists have said that climate change may be playing a role and that a warmer climate is likely to result in more intense hurricanes during an already-active season, like this one, though the ways climate change will affect the overall number of storms may vary. Conditions may shift for a few weeks, meaning that the season isn't likely to stay quite this active for the entirety of the hurricane season, Ventrice told Business Insider. We've already surpassed an average year and have more than half of hurricane season to go. Irma may very well be the strongest storm of the season. All rights reserved.

Florida and the Caribbean dig out of Hurricane Irma's devastation and begin a slow and costly recovery Rebecca Harrington Sep. 12, 2017, 10:17 AM createPerformanceMark('first image displayed'); Damaged street signs seen Monday among debris in the Naples Estates mobile-home park in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma in Naples, Florida. Residents across the Caribbean and Florida were starting to assess the damage on Monday. The storm is still hitting Georgia, Alabama, and the Carolinas. Hurricane Irma was one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, and its damage is just starting to emerge as the heavy rains and destructive winds give way to sunshine. Irma battered southern and western Caribbean islands last week as a massive Category 5 storm before crossing Cuba and the Bahamas and then making landfall on Florida's west coast on Sunday. As the storm finally left Florida on Monday and headed across Georgia, residents in the Sunshine State began assessing the havoc Irma wrecked amid flooded streets and lawns strewn with boats, mobile homes, cars, and debris. Three people in Georgia, one person in South Carolina, and seven people in Florida have died in the storm, bringing the total death toll to at least 48 people. That number is expected to rise. Overall, the destruction hasn't appeared to be as bad as officials feared, with Irma heading up the western coast of Florida instead of straight up the middle as it was forecast to on Thursday. Not as bad as Floridians feared Many residents who evacuated Miami when forecasters predicted it would take a direct hit found themselves in the storm's path after the hurricane turned and headed for Tampa on the west coast. Gov. Rick Scott of Florida said more than 6.5 million Floridians had been ordered to evacuate, and by Sunday morning 114,000 people were seeking refuge in 500 shelters statewide. There's devastation. Jean Chatelier walks through a flooded street from Hurricane Irma after retrieving his uniform from his house to return to work at a supermarket in Fort Myers, Fla. on Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2017. Many secondary roads were still full of downed power lines, trees, and other debris (if they weren't flooded) on Tuesday morning, and would take at least days to clear. To complicate matters, the gasoline supply in the state is dwindling and most grocery store shelves are wiped clean, since so many people rushed to get fuel and food before the storm, so even if residents return in the coming days, they may not have the supplies they need. By Tuesday morning, over 5.5 million homes and businesses in Florida were still without power, with another 1.3 million power failures in Georgia, 250,000 in South Carolina, and about 150,000 in North Carolina. Most of Puerto Rico is still without power as well. Power companies raced to restore electricity, repairing power lines toppled by Irma's winds. The US Environmental Protection Agency has waived pollution-control rules to allow utilities to burn whatever fuel they need to restore power. Pollution levels spiked after a similar decision was made after Hurricane Harvey in Texas, the Associated Press found. In the Florida Keys, which suffered a direct blow from Irma at Category 4 strength, the roads and bridges were destroyed by the powerful storm surge when the storm's strong winds blew walls of water onto the chain of islands. Scott said Monday that residents could begin to return only when officials inspected and cleared the 42-bridge Overseas Highway, according to the AP. Overturned trailer homes are shown in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma in in the Florida Keys on Monday, Sept. 11, 2017. In areas like Jacksonville, where floodwater reached waist-high, rescue workers scoured the still-swamped streets on Monday to pull people out. Before the storm hit, Scott ordered all 7,000 members of Florida's National Guard to report for duty, and nearly 14,000 total members from Florida and other states had evacuated over 12,000 citizens by Monday. President Donald Trump declared states of emergency in Florida, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands on Tuesday evening to free up federal resources to respond to the storm. Caribbean islands don't look the same Barbuda. Satellite images of the Virgin Islands before the storm showed lush greenery that was stripped of vegetation and turned brown after Irma swept through them with 185 mph winds: Natural-color images captured by NASA's Landsat 8 satellite of the British and US Virgin Islands before and after Hurricane Irma passed. NASA Waves 16 feet high struck Cuba on Saturday, forcing a million people to evacuate inland. Across the Caribbean, Irma left thousands homeless and sent recovery costs skyrocketing into at least billions of dollars. It will most likely take months, if not years, for areas to return to some sense of normalcy. All rights reserved.

You can always repair and rebuild -- and we'll be here to help you do that. Forecasters say Miami and Fort Lauderdale, the state's most densely populated areas with over 4 million people, would likely escape the worst winds, but would still face tropical-storm force winds of between 39 mph and 73 mph. In Haiti, officials dramatically increased the death toll Thursday night in that country to 283. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

The storm has hit several Caribbean islands, including Puerto Rico and St. Martin, and comes just weeks after flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey destroyed buildings and neighborhoods in Texas. Florida Gov. Rick Scott ordered an additional 700,000 residents to evacuate on Saturday morning, bringing the total number of people evacuating to nearly 7 million throughout Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Scott also activated the entire Florida National Guard on Tuesday, calling on all 7,000 members to report for duty on Friday morning. He asked President Donald Trump to declare a state of emergency for Florida to free up federal funding for evacuations and flooding infrastructure, which the president granted. He reiterated this point in multiple news conferences throughout the week. Hurricane-force winds extend about 70 miles in all directions from Irma's center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend 195 miles, according to the National Hurricane Center. Florida's peninsula is only about 140 miles across at its widest, so Irma could engulf the entire state with its powerful winds. Speaking from Hialeah on Thursday morning, Scott said his biggest concern with Irma is the massive storm surge and flooding. In a tweet, Scott also said that his administration's top priority is fuel availability, as gas stations in evacuation zones are running out of supplies. The Florida government is also staging supplies, meals, and water at locations around the state. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio also issued warnings about the hurricane on Twitter: Brock Long, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said that he has already deployed crisis professionals to assist in Florida. Evacuations Officials in Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, ordered a mandatory evacuation for all residents on Wednesday morning. The county's schools also closed, the Orlando Sentinel reports. Schools in Miami were closed Thursday and Friday. In this geocolor GOES-16 satellite image taken Thursday morning, Hurricane Irma batters the island of Hispaniola. NOAA-NASA via AP The Washington Post reported that some residents lined up for hours to fuel their vehicles. Traffic has been very slow along evacuation routes, though Scott waived all tolls to facilitate travel. Miami International Airport is open but has issued a travel warning ahead of the storm. Airline officials at Orlando International say they're monitoring the storm and will decide whether to relocate planes and move equipment off the runway as necessary. Airlines including American, JetBlue, Spirit, and Air Canada are issuing waivers for travelers to change their itineraries to a number of Florida airports for no fee. South Carolina, Georgia South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster also declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, as forecasts are predicting Irma could hit the state. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency in 30 counties in coastal Georgia, and issued an executive order authorizing up to 5,000 state National Guard troops to assist with rescue and relief efforts. Deal further ordered the mandatory evacuation of Chatham County and other coastal areas in Georgia. Hurricane warnings were also still in effect for parts of Cuba on Saturday. All rights reserved.

Earlier, hurricane warnings were in effect for St. Martin and St. Barthelemy. Both of those islands were already devastated by Hurricane Irma, which first made landfall early Wednesday. Those warning have been canceled. Luckily, the storm seems to be veering north, so its center will likely miss the islands of Barbuda and Anguilla, which are both still reeling from destruction caused by Irma. National Hurricane Center Although forecasters are watching Jose, Irma remains the most pressing concern, since the Category 4 storm has started to hit Florida. Many parts of Florida, including the Keys and parts of the Miami area, have been been evacuated. Meanwhile, the US is still recovering from the devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall on August 25 and severely flooded parts of Texas and Louisiana. The storm dumped as much as 51.88 inches of rain in some spots and caused at least 60 deaths. The peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is around September 10, so it's not uncommon for storms to form during this time of year. However, 2017 has been an unusually active year for hurricanes.

Irma was a hurricane for part of 12 days, having been dubbed a hurricane on Aug. 31, when it was far from land in the Atlantic Ocean. For days, it was a Category 5 storm, wreaking havoc in the Caribbean, where recovery efforts are still underway. On Monday morning, the storm brought storm surge risks as high as 4 to 6 feet above normal water levels in parts of Florida. Irma was also extending tropical-storm-force winds outward up 415 miles, the National Hurricane Center says.

Hurricane Irma made landfall twice in Florida on Sunday, smacking into the Florida Keys as a Category 4 storm before moving over water and hitting Marco Island as a Category 3 on Florida's southwest coast. Here are some of the stories we're seeing in Florida: Florida Keys From a flyover aboard a Coast Guard C-130 airplane, NPR's Connor Donevan saw extensive damage to the Keys, particularly in Marathon Island. Houses were wrecked, roofs ripped off. Mobile home parks in particular were devastated, with trailers flipped over and tossed around. Boats were capsized, and many had broken free of their moorings and been thrown ashore. A few cars were driving on the streets, including a solitary vehicle travelling west from Marathon along the Seven Mile Bridge. In a driving tour of the area surrounding Naval Air Station Key West, Connor saw many roads remained blocked by trees and downed power lines. Less-sturdy buildings had lost roofs or had doors blown in. At a gas station, the canopy and pumps were crumpled into a heap. Key West was still without power, water and cell service. But there were a number of civilians driving and walking around the island, which is under a sundown-to-sunup curfew. Thousands of people are believed to have resisted mandatory evacuation orders to stay in the Keys. The sheriff's office reported Monday evening that the number of customers without power is down to 177,652. Members of the group also used it to commiserate, share tips and vent their feelings about Irma. As the sun rose Monday, they also shared some of what they're seeing. The neighbor's screen patio was torn off and is laying in the street. The stop sign on the corner is missing. The neighbor behind us fence is down. We're missing some pieces from our roof overhang.

It was last updated to reflect the 8 a.m. Hurricane Irma, the massive, record-setting hurricane, continues on a collision course with South Florida where severe, if not catastrophic, damage is becoming inevitable. By early next week, Georgia and the Carolinas could also be in the storm's crosshairs. The storm is comparable in strength to Hurricane Andrew, which decimated parts of South Florida in 1992, but much larger in size. Thursday night, as the storm charged ever closer to the U.S. mainland, the National Hurricane Center issued hurricane warnings for the Florida peninsula from Jupiter Inlet southward and around the peninsula to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys. Hurricane and storm surge watches extended north of the warning area on Florida's east and west coast up to Sebastian Inlet and Anna Maria Island. Closer to the storm's immediate location, hurricane warnings remained in effect for the Bahamas, and northern Cuba. Irma was forecast to pass between the Central Bahamas and north coast of Cuba Friday, according to the Hurricane Center. Packing peak winds of 150 mph, Irma was an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm Friday morning. It is possible the storm could regain Category 5 intensity if it remains clear of large land masses, which would disrupt the storm. There is a scenario in which the center could scrape Cuba's north coast, which would weaken it. However, Irma is still to pass over some of the warmest water in the world (nearly 90 degrees), which could allow for restrengthening. It urged residents of Florida to rush preparations to completion. On Saturday, Jose could hit some of the same small islands in the northern Lesser Antilles decimated by Irma, including Antigua and Barbuda. Caption Irma is wielding the most powerful winds ever recorded for a storm in the Atlantic Ocean. Thais Llorca Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Potential effects on Florida and the Southeast U.S. In South Florida, this storm is being taken as deadly serious. Coastal areas are being evacuated, shelters are being established, and food and gas supplies have dwindled. Although there is uncertainty in the track and the exact path of the violent eye wall, where winds are the strongest, it will be difficult for the state to avoid a disaster: It's just a matter of how severe. Then, the all-important northward turn is still expected to take place early Sunday, when the storm would make landfall and unleash its worst effects. Exactly where the north turn occurs is the critical question for Florida. As of Friday morning, the most likely scenario based on computer-model guidance was that the storm will track between right up the spine of Florida to near its East Coast. Group of simulations from American (blue) and European (red) computer models from Thursday night. Each color strand represents a different model simulation with slight tweaks to initial conditions. Note that the strands are clustered together where the forecast track is most confident but they diverge where the course of the storm is less certain. The difference between a track just off the east coast and just off the west coast is only 150 miles, and the average error in hurricane forecasts this far in advance is nearly that big. It is still not out of the question that Irma could track north up the west coast of the Florida peninsula. If it runs up the spine of the peninsula, the storm will be quicker to decay but hurricane-force winds would reach both coasts. If it buzz-saws up the west coast, then Key West, Naples, Fort Myers, Tampa and Tallahassee would face severe effects. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles downed. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months. Note that such extreme winds are typically confined to the eye wall, which is only about 10 to 15 miles wide. That is why the exact track is important in terms of where the most severe wind damage concentrates. Forecast position of Hurricane Irma at 8 a.m. Sunday. Irrespective of exactly where Irma tracks, it appears inevitable that many coastal population centers in Florida will experience a devastating storm surge of 5 to 10 feet above normally dry land, inundating roads, homes and businesses. The biggest storm surge will occur immediately north of the storm center. Over the Florida peninsula, 8 to 20 inches of rain is forecast, with the heaviest amounts most likely in the southeast. Beyond Florida, there is a risk for destructive winds and a serious storm surge up to Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, but the details greatly depend on the track over Florida. The worst case for these states would be if Irma narrowly misses the east coast of Florida, stays over warm water and then hits them while maintaining its strength. A potential landfall along the Southeast coast would be Monday. However, a number of models early Friday suggested the storm would pass over Florida's spine and into interior Georgia, such that there would be no second landfall from Irma along the Southeast coast. Rainfall forecast from Irma. As the storm tracks up the Southeast coast and then inland, heavy rain will expand over a large area, along with the potential for flash flooding, although it's too soon to pinpoint what areas will receive the most rain. Effects on the Turks and Caicos and Bahamas Thursday evening, the center of the storm passed very close to the Turks and Caicos, producing potentially catastrophic Category 5 winds and 8 to 12 inches (locally up to 20 inches) of rain. The storm surge was of particular concern, as the water had the potential to rise 16 to 20 feet above normally dry land in coastal sections north of the storm center, causing extreme inundation. The Hurricane Center noted that the southern Bahamas and northern Cuba could receive 10 to 15 inches of rain with isolated 20-inch totals. Irma's path so far Through early Thursday, the storm had battered islands from Puerto Rico to the northern Lesser Antilles. Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the hurricane passed directly over Barbuda and St. Martin in the northern Leeward Islands, the strongest hurricane ever recorded in that region and tied with the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane as the strongest Atlantic storm to strike land. As Barbuda took a direct hit, the weather station there clocked a wind gust to 155 mph before it went offline. The storm also passed directly over Anguilla and St. Martin early Wednesday, causing severe damage. Among the most intense storms on record, it trails only Hurricane Allen in 1980, which had winds of 190 mph. It is tied for second-most intense with Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane. The storm maintained maximum wind speeds of at least 180 mph for 37 hours, longer than storm on Earth on record, passing Super Typhoon Haiyan, the previous recordholder (24 hours). Late Tuesday, its pressure dropped to 914 millibars (the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm), ranking as the lowest of any storm on record outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the Atlantic basin.

Some three million people on the U.S. southeast coast faced an urgent evacuation order Thursday as Hurricane Matthew bore down on Florida. Matthew hit them as a Category Four hurricane but has since been downgraded to three, on a scale of five, by the US National Hurricane Center. The first evacuations were ordered in the United States as coastal residents prepared to escape the approaching monster storm, expected off the East Coast later this week. The dangerous Category 4 storm blew ashore around dawn in Haiti. It unloaded heavy rain as it swirled on toward a lightly populated part of Cuba and the Bahamas. Hurricane Matthew roared into the southwestern coast of the island of Hispaniola with devastating storm conditions as it headed north toward Cuba and the eastern coast of Florida. As the Category 4 hurricane creeps closer, Cuba, in the likely path of destruction, ordered the evacuation of more than 250,000 people from the east of the island. Hurricane Matthew took aim at densely populated Haiti and Jamaica on Monday, packing winds that could sweep away flimsy buildings and bringing torrential rain that could trigger deadly landslides and floods. As the powerful storm churned north, officials in both countries scrambled to protect buildings and move people out of danger zones to shelters. All rights reserved."}

But with a key bridge washed out, roads impassable and phone communications down, the western tip of Haiti was isolated and there was no word on dead and injured there. Forecasters said strong winds, heavy rains and a dangerous storm surge were starting to spread over the Bahamas as Hurricane Matthew approached early Wednesday. The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said the powerful Category 3 hurricane was centered at 5 a.m. about 65 miles north-northwest of the eastern tip of Cuba. The storm was packing top sustained winds of 125 mph and was moving north at 10 mph, with some strengthening forecast in coming days. Airlines cancelling flights to Caribbean and Florida as Hurricane Matthew nears The hurricane center said winds had slightly decreased overnight as Matthew dropped from a Category 4 to the still powerful Category 3 storm. But forecasters warned such fluctuations in intensity were to be expected and that Matthew remained a potent and dangerous storm. There was growing concern on the U.S. East Coast, which was expected to come under threat after Matthew made a two-day surge up the length of the Bahamas. People raced to supermarkets, gas stations and hardware stores, buying up groceries, water, plywood, tarps, batteries and propane. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she would issue an evacuation order Wednesday so 1 million people would have time to leave the coast. The Red Cross put out a call for volunteers there. The White House said relief supplies were being moved to emergency staging areas in the Southeast. The city of Baracoa faced the most difficult situation because of its antiquated drainage system and overflowing rivers adding to the flooding from high waves and storm surge.

Matthew was at one point a Category 5 storm, making it the most powerful hurricane in the region in nearly a decade. It blew ashore around dawn in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and a place where many people live in shacks of wood or concrete blocks. Surging waters ripped away a bridge in the flooded town of Petit Goave, preventing any road travel to the hard-hit southwest. Local radio reported shoulder-high water in parts of the southern city of Les Cayes. Matthew swept away parts of Les Cayes, and resident George Elie told CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann it was devastating. Everything is gone. Milriste Nelson, a 65-year-old farmer in the town of Leogane, said neighbors fled when the wind tore away the corrugated metal roof on their home. His own small yard was strewn with the fruit he depends on for his livelihood. Haitian authorities had tried to evacuate people from the most vulnerable areas ahead of the storm, but many were reluctant to leave their homes.

Its members trace the origin of hurricane hunting to a 1943 barroom dare by two then-Army Air Corps pilots to fly through a hurricane off Texas. Today, the missions are carried out largely by Air Force reservists who, after a few days or weeks of chasing storms, return to their jobs in the civilian world. Hitterman, 49, flies for Delta Airlines most of the time and, as a hobby, races motorcycles. She normally lives in Minnesota. The way Mitchell sees it, the more accurate her data is, the more accurate the forecasts can be that tell U.S. citizens whether to evacuate their homes as Irma or other storms advance. Millions of Florida residents have been ordered to evacuate. The last time was in 1974. But they are not without risk. Some six hurricane or typhoon hunting aircraft have been lost in total, costing 53 lives, according to the Weather Underground website. The pilot lost control of the aircraft, one of the engines caught on fire, and the aircraft descended rapidly, all because satellite data had given his crew the sense they were flying into a Category 3 storm. It turned out to be a Category 5. They were flying much too low for a storm that potent. On the mission into Irma, jolts of turbulence also shook the equipment in the cabin as it neared the eye of the hurricane. Emergency parachutes swayed. It was safe enough to take off seat belts. The flying was smooth. Inside the eye, the sky opened up. DRONES AND SONDES Masters says someday drones might be able to do the risky job now done by experienced air crews. But, from the cockpit of this Hurricane Hunter flight, that possibility still seems distant. Some of that equipment is operated manually. So, Moore took out a screwdriver and literally started fixing them on the fly, one by one. That is something a drone would not be able to do.

It would be far worse than Andrew. Such a scenario cannot entirely be ruled out with Hurricane Irma. He stayed on air for 23 straight hours and is considered a hero by many who was glued to his coverage. Andrew, as bad as it was, wasn't the worst-case scenario for South Florida. While it ravaged the Homestead area, the more densely-populated coast from Miami to Fort Lauderdale missed the brunt of the storm. Norcross is particularly concerned about the scenario in which the storm surge exceeds 10 feet in the Miami area. In recent decades, the population in southeast Florida has ballooned and an incredible amount of wealth and infrastructure is in harm's way. It's possible it will track just far enough west, perhaps over the Everglades, so that the densely-populated Miami to Fort Lauderdale corridor narrowly avoids the worst of Irma's wrath. But a small wobble to the east would place Miami and its surroundings in Irma's northeastern eyewall, where winds are most destructive and the storm surge is maximized. Even if the worst case doesn't materialize in Miami, Norcross said he is deeply concerned about South Florida's readiness for something even less.

It could dump up to 15 inches of rain there -- an amount that could trigger dangerous flooding and mudslides, the US National Hurricane Center said. Hurricane Irma: Live updates Damage from Hurricane Irma is seen here after it slammed Point Blanche, St. Martin on September 6, 2017. Prime Minister Gaston Browne said the government has called for voluntary evacuations from Barbuda. Irma left at least 10 people dead Wednesday, including four on St. Martin, four in the US Virgin Islands, one on Anguilla, and one on Barbuda, officials said. The latter is barely habitable, with nearly all its buildings damaged, Browne said. Jose became the third major hurricane of the Atlantic basin season on Thursday, with winds of 120 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The Category 3 storm is about 625 miles east-southeast of Antigua. Here are the latest developments -- Around 8 p.m. ET, Irma's center was about 55 miles west-southwest of Grand Turk Island, moving west-northwest with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph. Hurricane-force winds could be felt as far as 70 miles from the center. Irma previously had winds over 180 mph, keeping those speeds longer than any storm ever recorded in the Atlantic basin. -- Irma could cross the southeastern Bahamas on Thursday evening and be near the central Bahamas on Friday. -- Hurricane warnings are in effect for parts of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the southeastern, central and northwestern Bahamas. -- A hurricane watch has been issued for Jupiter Inlet on Florida's east coast to Bonita Beach on the west coast. It includes the Florida Keys to Lake Okeechobee. -- Gov.

Many Floridians spent Thursday stocking up on food or making plans to head inland. Miami resident Ashley Hahn was at a beach Thursday with her 4-year-old daughter, saying they were taking a final few dips before fleeing the storm. Florida is not the only state preparing for possible impact. Georgia's Gov. Deal declared a state of emergency for 30 counties. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster also declared states of emergency. Turks and Caicos, Bahamas in Irma's path Irma was bringing heavy rain and powerful winds to the low-lying Turks and Caicos Islands on Thursday afternoon. Residents were told to stay put. Storm surges could reach up to 20 feet, the National Hurricane Center says -- twice as high as some of the islands' elevations. The Turks and Caicos are a British overseas territory with about 35,000 people. Trail of destruction Irma's eye passed directly over Barbuda on Wednesday, leaving the small island's 1,800 residents largely incommunicado for hours because it knocked over the telecommunications system and cell towers. Some spoke of taking shelter in bathrooms as their homes were torn apart. A car turned onto its side in Marigot, near the Bay of Nettle, on the French Collectivity of Saint Martin, after the passage of Hurricane Irma on Sept.6, 2010. In Puerto Rico, about 56,680 customers were without water, with the island's northeast hit the hardest, according to Jesus Poupart of the emergency operations center. Emergency officials are still taking in reports to determine the extent of the damage. He said he wouldn't be able to reopen the place for about five days. In the northeast city of Fajardo, authorities conducted at least 10 rescues, an emergency dispatcher there told CNN. Of those, five were from flooded homes, two of people trapped in vehicles, and three who were trapped in an elevator, the dispatcher said.

The National Hurricane Center has verified Klotzbach's tally of Irma's place in history, adding that some of the figures could change when the formal Tropical Cyclone Report is released later this year. Irma has now been the subject of more than 80 advisories from the hurricane center, with the first dating back to Aug. 30, when it was a tropical storm with sustained wind speeds of 50 mph. In the span of 24 hours, Irma became a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph. On Monday, Sept. 4, Irma's sustained winds were 120 mph. On Sept. 5, they were 185 mph, with gusts of 213 mph. When it finally hit land, it devastated Barbuda, St. Martin and other Leeward islands with direct hits, and brought massive flooding to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. It was the first Category 5 hurricane to hit the tropical Atlantic since Hugo in 1989, Klotzbach says. Enlarge this image Hurricane Irma approached Florida as a Category 4 hurricane on Sunday.

Flash-flood watches and warnings were issued around the Southeast. Search-and-rescue teams made their way into the more distant reaches of the Keys, and an aircraft carrier was positioned off Key West to help. Officials said it was not known how many people ignored evacuation orders and stayed behind in the Keys. Crews also worked to repair two washed-out, 300-foot (90-meter) sections of U.S. 1, the highway that runs through the Keys, and check the safety of the 42 bridges linking the islands.

Scott urged coastal residents to prepare for the possibility of a direct hit and line up three days' worth of food, water and medicine. The White House said relief supplies were being moved to emergency staging areas in the Southeast. The slow-moving storm was expected to drench the coast from the Florida Keys through central Florida, bring storm surge up to 5 feet deep along the Atlantic coast and possibly spawn tornadoes. Even if Matthew doesn't come ashore, its tropical storm-force winds could reach the state. Mandatory evacuations were already underway in Brevard County, and voluntary evacuations have been activated in St. Lucie County, but Gov.

Matthew hit them as a Category Four hurricane but has since been downgraded to three, on a scale of five, by the US National Hurricane Center. The first evacuations were ordered in the United States as coastal residents prepared to escape the approaching monster storm, expected off the East Coast later this week.

Hurricane Matthew roared into the southwestern coast of the island of Hispaniola with devastating storm conditions as it headed north toward Cuba and the eastern coast of Florida. As the Category 4 hurricane creeps closer, Cuba, in the likely path of destruction, ordered the evacuation of more than 250,000 people from the east of the island.

The National Hurricane Center has listed hurricane warnings as of 5 p.m. on Wednesday for the British and US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the southeastern and central Bahamas, and Turks and Caicos. Parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti have warnings as well. Beyond that, there's uncertainty about where the storm will go. Forecasters then often aggregate data from multiple models, weighting ones that have proved most accurate. The paths aren't all equally likely to happen, so you can't just look at a spaghetti plot and easily interpret where the storm will go. The latest official forecast from the NHC shows the probable path of the storm touching Southern Florida right over Miami sometime Sunday afternoon and then heading north up the state's east coast. National Hurricane Center That looks bad enough for Miami and South Florida that evacuations have already been ordered for numerous at-risk areas. But there's still significant uncertainty about where the storm could hit that far in the future. The first is statistical guidance, which is based on historical data of tropical storms; the second is dynamical models that build the physics of the atmosphere in the simulation. Those dynamical models are more heavily weighted now by the NHC than many of the statistical models. The two main physics-based models are GFS, which is primarily run in the US, and Euro models that come from Europe. The consensus forecast takes into account different models, using them to estimate the intensity of the storm and develop a cone within which the storm is most likely to travel. But even the intensity of a hurricane can deviate from projections. That main forecast projects that Irma will remain a Category 5 storm until Saturday and then become a Category 4 storm this weekend. The inherent uncertainty in storm models, however, doesn't change the fact that this storm has already devastated several islands and appears to be headed toward the US, even if it's unclear precisely where yet.

Officials reported that the mass evacuation of millions of residents of coastal and vulnerable areas close to inland water had mostly gone smoothly, despite shortages of fuel and gridlock on major highways. By late afternoon, however, the northbound I-75 near Ocala was gridlocked. Further north in Georgia, another half-million residents were told to evacuate. Although Irma is forecast to weaken as it travels north over land, authorities in Georgia and Alabama urged residents to be on alert for heavy rains, wind and flooding as early as Monday. Across Florida, close to 100,000 customers had lost power by late Saturday, most of them in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. Crews worked to restore about half of them before strengthening winds made it too dangerous to work. The number of outages was expected to grow. In Miami-Dade county, almost 50,000 were without power. Let me make this clear, Miami-Dade is still being affected by Irma and there are already reports of hurricane force gusts. In Miami, the streets were virtually empty by Saturday morning, with all petrol stations, supermarkets and other commercial outlets closed.

Store shelves are empty and gas stations are running out of fuel as residents along Florida's east coast prepare for Hurricane Matthew. This was the third-strongest rapid intensification in a 24-hour period for any Atlantic hurricane on record, trailing only Hurricane Wilma (2005) and Hurricane Felix (2007). But the Caribbean is very warm and very deep, which means there was less cold water to churn. As such, Matthew has been able to sustain itself as a very strong hurricane for a long time. This index takes into account intensity and duration of a hurricane. Hurricane Matthew generated the most ACE of any hurricane in the eastern Caribbean on record. Given the forecast track and intensity of Matthew, it is likely to be one of the highest-generating ACE storms of the past 50 years. As such, Matthew has set some notable landfall records as well. Hurricane Matthew was the first Category 4 hurricane to make landfall in Cuba since Hurricane Ike (2008). The latest National Hurricane Center forecast as well as model guidance indicate that Matthew may last in the Atlantic for another week or more. This would put Matthew in rare territory for hurricane longevity, especially one this late in the season. No hurricanes on record have made landfall north of Miami along the east coast of Florida in October, and as mentioned earlier, no major hurricanes have made landfall since Wilma in 2005.

With the storm still five days away from the outermost Caribbean islands and at least a week away from any potential US impacts, there is still a lot of uncertainty about where it will go. Hurricane Harvey underwent rapid intensification just before it made landfall late last Friday, strengthening quickly from a tropical storm into a Category 4 hurricane when it moved onshore near Corpus Christi, Texas. Cape Verde storms frequently become some of the largest and most intense hurricanes. Hurricane Irma is forecast to continue to strengthen as it moves westward over the next five days, and the official forecast from the National Hurricane Center puts a dangerous Category 4 Hurricane Irma on the doorstep of the Caribbean by the end of the five-day forecast on Wednesday. Wind shear is like hurricane kryptonite, and prevents storms from forming or gaining strength. From there, the forecast becomes a lot less clear, with some major differences among some of the key models meteorologists use to forecast hurricanes. The differences are so drastic that one prediction has Irma sliding harmlessly back out to sea, while in another, it makes multiple disastrous landfalls in the Caribbean and likely hits the United States after that. Dueling prediction models The European model, or ECMWF, and the American GFS model have had some notable showdowns before, most notably with Hurricane Sandy. There have been other examples in which the GFS model has outperformed its European counterpart, such as with a few major snowstorms in the Northeast. Right now, the GFS has Irma taking a more northerly track that curves to the north before it reaches the Caribbean, thus making a US landfall much less likely. The European model keeps the storm tracking further west, nearing the Bahamas by the end of next week. The forecast picture should become clearer after the weekend. Bottom line: Hurricane Irma is already a powerful hurricane and looks to only become more so. Those with interests in the Caribbean and southeast US coast should pay close attention to the forecast.

Meteorologists said storm surge had been measured at more than 4 feet in some areas. The storm sparked flash-flood concerns. The National Weather Service issued a warning for parts of Nassau County, north of Jacksonville. Related Story Thousands of Flights Canceled as Hurricane Matthew Churns Toward Florida The Category 3 hurricane has left more than 1 million people without power as it skirts the state's east coast, with the most damaging blow possibly still to come. Governors in North and South Carolina warned residents to get out in advance of the storm, which could drop as much as 15 inches of rain. But it's not as if Matthew -- with winds of 115 mph at the center -- didn't cause any damage with its powerful winds. Parts of St. Augustine flooded even as the hurricane was still approaching. A virtual river of water rushed past a bed and breakfast business in the city about 35 miles southeast of Jacksonville, according to video posted by reporter Russell Colburn of CNN affiliate WJAX. Hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 60 miles from that center. It was moving north at 12 mph. The center considers it a storm-related death because firefighters had to stop responding to emergency calls because of high winds. Anything over 3 feet in the city is life-threatening, Mayor Lenny Curry said. The majority died in Haiti, said Civil Protection Service spokesman Joseph Edgard Celestin. 'Really dangerous' Though the storm hasn't made landfall, it left swaths of coastal Florida with downed trees and power lines. Matthew kicked up debris and street flooding in Daytona Beach late Friday morning. Video recorded by journalist Robert Ray showed metallic, foil-like debris and other small objects rolling down one of the streets in the city. Florida Govs. Rick Scott said officials are particularly concerned about low-lying areas in and around Jacksonville, where there is potential for significant flooding. He said all major roads and interstate highways were open as of late morning, and no major road or traffic issues were reported. In some of the counties that the storm has passed, it appeared that evacuations urged by local officials worked, he said. More than 22,000 people were in shelters statewide, he said. President Barack Obama urged people in coastal northeastern Florida and Georgia to heed the instructions of local officials as Hurricane Matthew approached. Major southern Florida population centers such as Miami and West Palm Beach appeared to have avoided the worst of the storm, as the dangerous eyewall stayed about 100 miles off the coast. Parts of the Miami area saw tropical storm force winds, but higher hurricane force winds were a couple hundred miles farther north. Winds knocked down power lines in Miami-Dade County, leaving tens of thousands without electricity. But only 1,000 customers were still in the dark Friday afternoon, Florida Power & Light said. Officials in eastern Florida, Georgia and South Carolina urged people to evacuate coastal areas. Airline passengers were urged to call and check on the status of their scheduled flights before leaving for the airport. Florida airports had canceled hundreds of flights, most of them in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Orlando. Fort Lauderdale closed its airport, airlines suspended operations in Miami and Orlando's airport closed Thursday evening. Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina As northeastern Florida braced for impact, coastal communities in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina also were on notice. The storm's center could be near or over the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina on Saturday, the hurricane center said. Tommy Tillman of the Chatham County Sheriff's Office said the road to Tybee Island is closed. Deal has activated 1,000 National Guard troops. Dorchester, Beaufort, Jasper and Williamsburg counties will be under curfew. Charleston's curfew starts at midnight. The curfews end each morning, at different times. A major storm surge of 8 feet or more is approaching low-lying areas in the state, including Charleston. Officials in some areas are going door to door, urging people to leave. Police in Pawleys Island asked residents who decided to stay in spite of the evacuation orders to sign a waiver and list their next of kin, according to CNN affiliate WBTW.

Hurricane Matthew roared across the southwestern tip of Haiti with 145 mph winds Tuesday, uprooting trees and tearing roofs from homes in a largely rural corner of the impoverished country as the storm headed north toward Cuba and the east coast of Florida. Further up the East Coast, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley also announced plans starting Wednesday afternoon to evacuate a quarter million people, not counting tourists, from its vulnerable coastline. Residents who live in mobile and manufactured homes also are being ordered to leave. In South Carolina, Haley said two major coastal counties would begin evacuating residents from vulnerable coastal areas within hours. She said some 315 buses were being dispatched to the area. The National Guard and other law enforcement agents are mobilized, ready to ensure an orderly evacuation. The evacuation of the greater Charleston County and Beaufort areas announced by Haley was set to take effect at 3 p.m., but traffic already was bumper-to-bumper during morning rush hour on Interstate 26 as people fled ahead of the storm. Gasoline was hard to come by during morning rush hour, with at least half a dozen stations in Mount Pleasant out of fuel and lines at others.

Already the hurricane was spreading high winds, heavy rain and a dangerous storm surge ahead of it as it neared the Bahamas. It added that while maximum winds decreased slightly in recent hours, the fluctuation in intensity was expected and some slight strengthening is forecast in coming days. Officials hope to avoid a repeat of Hurricanes Wilma and Katrina, which caused major damage to South Florida in 2005, and Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm, leveled much of the city of Homestead in 1992. The Miami forecasters issued a hurricane warning for the area north of Golden Beach near Fort Lauderdale to Sebastian Inlet, meaning hurricane force winds of 74 mph or higher are expected within two days. A hurricane watch is also in effect from Sebastian Inlet to Fernandina Beach, meaning hurricane force winds could occur. In South Florida, lines at grocery stores were heavier than usual on Tuesday and some essentials were in short supply. When Simone Corrado and her husband tried to buy water at their Publix in Davie near Fort Lauderdale, they mostly found empty shelves. There were a few bottles of high-end water brands, but there was so much empty shelf space that Corrado lay down and fully stretched out on the bottom shelf.

Hurricane Hermine became the first to strike Florida since Wilma in 2005 when it hit the eastern Panhandle on Sept. 2 as a Category 1 storm, causing one death, storm surge damage to beachfront homes and downed trees and powerlines. That 11-year lull between storms hitting Florida was the longest on record. The last storm to hit Florida from the Atlantic side was Katrina, which struck on its way to devastating the Gulf coast. It concluded a two-year span when a record eight hurricanes hit the state.

The National Hurricane Center on Thursday issued a hurricane watch for the southernmost part of Florida, the first such alert Irma has prompted in the continental United States. A storm surge watch, which warned of potentially life-threatening levels of water, was also issued for the southern part of the state, an area that includes the Florida Keys, which a day earlier had begun evacuations. With potentially millions of people hitting the road to escape, Scott said emergency efforts were underway to keep fuel shipments moving to gas stations. Increasing evacuations were getting underway across South Florida. On Thursday, Broward County began to evacuate people from the area along the Atlantic. Miami-Dade County, which had announced evacuations on Wednesday, expanded the order on Thursday to include more people across the coastal portion of the county. In Naples, Fla., a Best Buy opened on Thursday morning to about two dozen shoppers waiting outside. Mike Ducheneau, the manager, said that the store had gotten about 20 or 30 cellphone chargers delivered the previous night. The shoppers waiting in line flooded to the cellphone section, snatching up the chargers that remained. Haiti raised its hurricane alert level to red, its highest, and the north coast remained under a hurricane watch as the central coast faced the threat of tropical storm winds and rain. Nevertheless, aid groups said the national hurricane response appeared to be slow. Many evacuations in the north were set to unfold as rains rapidly approached and low-quality shelters were still being finished. School was canceled across the country as national warnings went out through social media, radio and television. In some remote towns, word to take shelter was being spread largely via local officials with bullhorns. One major concern was the spread of a cholera outbreak already plaguing Haiti. Many groups said they were poised with teams and vehicles to help bring in medical and food aid. Caption Irma is wielding the most powerful winds ever recorded for a storm in the Atlantic Ocean.

More than 5,500 people in the country were evacuated in the run-up to the storm, officials said. On the islands of Barbuda and Anguilla, meanwhile, at least one death was reported on each. The death toll fluctuated Thursday as officials released, then revised, the number of fatalities. And with places in the Caribbean taking direct hits from Irma, the toll was expected to rise when officials are able to communicate with people on the devastated islands. The National Hurricane Center in Miami was remarkably calm and hushed on Thursday, considering the storm that is fast approaching. The center on the campus of Florida International University, a location that puts it much further from the coast than the old headquarters in Coral Gables, which was badly damaged during Hurricane Andrew a quarter-century ago. The forecasters here are giving regular updates on Hurricane Irma and taking turns giving TV interviews. The place will get busier in the next few days, and on Saturday night will go into lockdown, with metal shutters enclosing the doors and everyone in for the night until the storm passes. That storm, along with the recent devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey in Texas, has lingered in the background of the urgent warnings issued by Florida officials. States of emergency were also declared in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. On Thursday, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R) expanded his declaration from six coastal counties to 30 total counties, issuing a mandatory evacuation for some areas. Officials across Florida responded to the alarming forecasts by slowly shutting down the contours of daily life. Schools closed across the state, including the University of Central Florida in Orlando, which could face punishing weather if Irma crawls up the coastline. The University of Florida, located inland in Gainesville, announced that it was canceling a football game scheduled for Saturday and would then close its campus on Sunday and Monday.

Forecasters upgraded their alert for South Florida to a warning. Behind the Category 5 storm is the path of devastation it has already beaten through the eastern Caribbean; ahead of it still, according to the National Hurricane Center, lies the coast of South Florida. The storm, one of most powerful Atlantic Ocean hurricanes ever recorded, has been blamed for at least eight deaths so far, though there have been reports of several more and the death toll is expected to rise. Hundreds of thousands of other people are being ordered to get out of Irma's way. A hurricane warning is now in effect for parts of Florida, from Jupiter Inlet (north of West Palm Beach) south around the peninsula to Bonita Beach (south of Fort Myers). A warning means hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area. The alert also covers the Florida Keys, Lake Okeechobee and Florida Bay. The National Hurricane Center also highlights a storm surge warning for Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, along with the Keys. The statement says a surge warning means there is a danger of life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the coastline during the next 36 hours.

Leaders in those states aren't waiting to make a move. Gov. Henry McMaster has already declared a state of emergency in South Carolina, while Gov. Nathan Deal has declared a state of emergency in 30 counties in Georgia. Under the latest forecast models, Irma would swing north and hit Florida full-on as a major hurricane Sunday, moving its way into Georgia by Monday. Irma's destructive path through the Caribbean After passing north of Puerto Rico, Irma has followed the same angle past Hispaniola, the island that is home to the Dominican Republic and Haiti. As of 8 p.m. ET, its eye was directly between Haiti and Turks and Caicos. Enlarge this image An aerial photograph released by the Dutch Department of Defense shows the damage from Hurricane Irma in Philipsburg, on the Dutch portion of the Caribbean island of Sint Maarten. St. Martin, Anguilla and Barbuda, however, bore the brunt of Irma's destruction. A hurricane watch was issued for Antigua and Barbuda and other islands. With both the islands of St. Thomas and St. John without electricity, authorities are struggling to move hospital patients off the islands for treatment, with the help of U.S. military aircraft. The Two-Way Irma Portends New Woes For Debt-Stricken Puerto Rico Floodwaters swamped cars and houses in Puerto Rico, where seven rivers are now running above their flood levels, according to the National Weather Service office in San Juan, capital of the U.S. territory. The human toll and damages from Irma are still being realized, partly because of the wreckage and debris the hurricane has left in its wake and partly because of communications networks being brought down by powerful winds and flying debris. At least four people were killed and dozens wounded in St. Martin, French officials said Thursday (earlier, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said eight had died). The island is divided between French and Dutch administrations. Those deaths have not been confirmed. The hurricane is now moving west-northwest at 16 mph, progressing toward the Bahamas.

National Hurricane Center hide caption toggle caption National Hurricane Center The five-day path prediction for Hurricane Irma includes a northern turn close to the coast of Florida. National Hurricane Center Where Irma goes from here Irma's path is now projected to pivot north as it nears Florida. The timing of that turn is crucial to millions of people in the state, many of whom live in places already under mandatory evacuation orders. Those orders took effect in Key West on Wednesday; they now also cover barrier islands, including Miami Beach. Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez's order now covers about 650,000 people, out of the 2.7 million in the county. He said the closure will ensure extra space for sheltering evacuees and staging emergency responssefforts. There has been a run on gasoline, water and batteries, NPR's Greg Allen reports. In downtown Miami, Greg adds, officials who are preparing for Irma are worried about more than 20 tall construction cranes, especially ones that tower over residential areas. Tropical-storm-force winds will arrive in southern Florida and the Keys on Saturday, the hurricane center predicts. Absolutely uncanny copy-paste from 7 years ago. Very bizarre. The National Weather Service says all Coast Guard search-and-rescue vessels have left the area and the Port of Key West is closing Friday morning. As Irma moves west in the Caribbean, its storm surge poses a dangerous threat. The NHC estimates that by the time the storm has passed, Turks and Caicos and parts of the southeastern and central Bahamas will have seen coastal water rise 15 to 20 feet above normal levels. Cuba's northern coast could get a surge of 5 to 10 feet. Forecasters are also monitoring Jose, which is tracking behind Irma, as well as Hurricane Katia, which is off Mexico's southern state of Veracruz. As Jose moves west, it is likely to take a more northward approach than Irma. But before it veers north of Puerto Rico, the hurricane could add to the miseries Irma brought to St. Martin, Barbuda and other areas. Jose is predicted to remain a major hurricane (meaning its winds are at least 111 mph) when it nears those islands early Saturday. In the Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Center says Katia is heading west-southwest and likely make landfall on Mexico's coast late Friday or early Saturday.

The storm has hit several Caribbean islands, including Puerto Rico and St. Martin, and comes just weeks after flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey destroyed buildings and neighborhoods in Texas. Florida Gov. Rick Scott ordered an additional 700,000 residents to evacuate on Saturday morning, bringing the total number of people evacuating to nearly 7 million throughout Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Scott also activated the entire Florida National Guard on Tuesday, calling on all 7,000 members to report for duty on Friday morning. He asked President Donald Trump to declare a state of emergency for Florida to free up federal funding for evacuations and flooding infrastructure, which the president granted. He reiterated this point in multiple news conferences throughout the week. Hurricane-force winds extend about 70 miles in all directions from Irma's center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend 195 miles, according to the National Hurricane Center. Florida's peninsula is only about 140 miles across at its widest, so Irma could engulf the entire state with its powerful winds. Speaking from Hialeah on Thursday morning, Scott said his biggest concern with Irma is the massive storm surge and flooding. In a tweet, Scott also said that his administration's top priority is fuel availability, as gas stations in evacuation zones are running out of supplies. The Florida government is also staging supplies, meals, and water at locations around the state. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio also issued warnings about the hurricane on Twitter: Brock Long, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said that he has already deployed crisis professionals to assist in Florida. Evacuations Officials in Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, ordered a mandatory evacuation for all residents on Wednesday morning. The county's schools also closed, the Orlando Sentinel reports. Schools in Miami were closed Thursday and Friday. In this geocolor GOES-16 satellite image taken Thursday morning, Hurricane Irma batters the island of Hispaniola. NOAA-NASA via AP The Washington Post reported that some residents lined up for hours to fuel their vehicles. Traffic has been very slow along evacuation routes, though Scott waived all tolls to facilitate travel. Miami International Airport is open but has issued a travel warning ahead of the storm. Airline officials at Orlando International say they're monitoring the storm and will decide whether to relocate planes and move equipment off the runway as necessary. Airlines including American, JetBlue, Spirit, and Air Canada are issuing waivers for travelers to change their itineraries to a number of Florida airports for no fee. South Carolina, Georgia South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster also declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, as forecasts are predicting Irma could hit the state. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency in 30 counties in coastal Georgia, and issued an executive order authorizing up to 5,000 state National Guard troops to assist with rescue and relief efforts. Deal further ordered the mandatory evacuation of Chatham County and other coastal areas in Georgia. Hurricane warnings were also still in effect for parts of Cuba on Saturday. All rights reserved.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Irma was expected to gain a little more strength as it moved through the Straits of Florida and remain a powerful hurricane as it approaches Florida. Tens of thousands of people huddling in shelters watched for updates as the storm swung to the west, now potentially sparing Tampa as well Miami the catastrophic head-on blow forecasters had been warning about for days. But those few miles meant St. Petersburg could get a direct hit, rather than its more populous twin across Tampa Bay. Neither city has suffered a major hurricane in nearly a century. The streets emptied and shops were boarded up before the wind started to howl. About 6.4 million people were told to flee. But because the storm is 350 to 400 miles wide, the entire Florida peninsula was exposed. Forecasters said the greater Miami area of 6 million people could still get life-threatening hurricane winds and storm surge of 4 to 6 feet. The area has not been struck by a major hurricane since 1921, when its population was about 10,000, National Hurricane Center spokesman Dennis Feltgen said. Now around 3 million people live there. Many businesses had yet to protect windows with plywood or hurricane shutters. Nearly the entire Florida coastline remained under hurricane watches and warnings, and the latest projections could shift again, sparing or savaging other parts of the state. WATCH: What Florida can expect from Hurricane Irma The westward shift prompted Pinellas County, home to St. Petersburg, to order 260,000 people to leave, while Georgia scaled back evacuation orders for some coastal residents. Motorists heading inland from the Tampa area were allowed to drive on the shoulders. In the Orlando area, Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and Sea World all were closing Saturday.

Irma broke the record for consecutive hours at Category 5 on Sept. 7. But hurricane strength is about more than just maximum wind speed. A very large storm with moderate winds may have more total energy than an intense but small storm. The map above, provided by RMS, a company specializing in risk assessment, compares the energy of Irma at its peak with other historic and recent hurricanes in the Atlantic basin. Hurricane Sandy, not depicted in this map, was a Category 1, but according to RMS carried 330 terajoules of energy before its landfall in New Jersey because its wind field was so big.

NOAA ST. Irma, which was the strongest Atlantic hurricane ever recorded north of the Caribbean and east of the Gulf of Mexico, passed almost directly over the island of Barbuda, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. Authorities in the small islands of the eastern Caribbean were still evaluating the situation at first light though there were widespread reports of flooding and downed trees. Antiguan police were waiting until the winds dropped before sending helicopters to check on damage reports of damage in Barbuda. There were no immediate reports of casualties. As the eye of Hurricane Irma passed over Barbuda around 1:47 a.m., phone lines went down under heavy rain and howling winds that sent debris flying as people huddled in their homes or government shelters. A member of the Emergency Operations Committee (COE) monitors the trajectory of Hurricane Irma in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic September 5, 2017. The Category 5 storm also knocked out communication between islands. Midcie Francis of the National Office of Disaster Services confirmed there was damage to several homes, but said it was too early to assess the extent of damage. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 kph), according to the Hurricane Center. It said winds would likely fluctuate slightly, but the storm would remain at Category 4 or 5 strength for the next day or two. The most dangerous winds, usually nearest to the eye, were forecast to pass near the northern Virgin Islands and near or just north of Puerto Rico on Wednesday. President Donald Trump declared emergencies in Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and authorities in the Bahamas said they would evacuate six southern islands. Warm water is fuel for hurricanes and Irma was moving over water that was 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) warmer than normal. The 79 degree (26 Celsius) water that hurricanes need went about 250 feet (80 meters) deep, said Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the private forecasting service Weather Underground. Four other storms have had winds as strong in the overall Atlantic region, but they were in the Caribbean Sea or the Gulf of Mexico, which usually have warmer waters. Hurricane Allen hit 190 mph in 1980, while 2005's Wilma, 1988's Gilbert and a 1935 great Florida Keys storm all had 185 mph winds. A Home Depot store employee helps to load bags of sand for customers in the Little Havana neighborhood in Miami Thomson Reuters The northern Leeward Islands were expected to see normal tide levels rise by as much as 11 feet (3.3 meters), while the Turks and Caicos Islands and southeastern Bahamas could see surge of 20 feet (6 meters) and higher waves later in the week, forecasters said. People there would be flown to Nassau in what he called the largest storm evacuation in the country's history. The U.S. National Weather Service said Puerto Rico had not seen a hurricane of Irma's magnitude since Hurricane San Felipe in 1928, which killed a total of 2,748 people in Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico and Florida. The eye of the storm was expected to rip westward on a path taking it a little north of Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba. The northern parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti could see 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain, with as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) in the southeast Bahamas and Turks and Caicos. The storm seemed almost certain to hit the United States by early next week. In Florida, people stocked up on drinking water and other supplies. Florida Gov. Rick Scott activated 100 members of the Florida National Guard to be deployed across the state, and 7,000 National Guard members were to report for duty Friday when the storm could be approaching the area. On Monday, Scott declared a state of emergency in all of Florida's 67 counties. Mayor Carlos Gimenez said the voluntary evacuations could begin as soon as Wednesday evening. He activated the emergency operation center and urged residents to have three days' worth of food and water. The Hurricane Center in Miami said hurricane-force winds extended 50 miles (85 kilometers) from Irma's center and tropical storm-force winds extended 175 miles (280 kilometers). Also Wednesday morning, a new tropical storm formed in the Gulf of Mexico off Mexico's coast. Tropical Storm Katia had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph) with some strengthening forecast over the next two days. But the hurricane center said Katia was expected to stay offshore through Friday morning. And another tropical storm farther east in the Atlantic was expected to become a hurricane by Wednesday night. Tropical Storm Jose's maximum sustained winds had increased to near 60 mph (95 kph). The storm was centered about 1,255 miles (2,020 kilometers) east of the Lesser Antilles and was moving west near 13 mph (20 kph). All rights reserved.

After last year, it's a message that carries some weight. In the days before Hurricane Irma struck Florida last September, nearly 7 million residents left their homes to seek shelter and safety elsewhere. Since then, emergency managers and researchers have been studying the lessons of the largest hurricane evacuation in U.S. history. Hurricane Irma hit the Florida Keys as a Category 4 storm and then took a track up the entire Florida Peninsula. Heavy traffic clogged major Florida highways as millions evacuated. Mandatory evacuations were ordered first in the Florida Keys. As the storm approached, emergency managers in nearly every coastal county followed. The Two-Way Millions In Florida Ordered To Evacuate As Irma Crashes Past Cuba Richard Olson, director of the International Hurricane Research Center at Florida International University, says that as mass evacuations go, it was successful. It wasn't the nightmare scenario Texans experienced in 2005 as millions fled the advance of Hurricane Rita. Thousands in Texas were stranded in a 100-mile traffic jam after they ran out of gas. Twenty-four people died in a bus fire. In that case, as with Irma, the damage ultimately done by the hurricane didn't justify the massive evacuation beforehand. Bill Johnson, the director of emergency management in Palm Beach County, says nearly half of those who fled their homes for Hurricane Irma were from areas where evacuations had not been ordered. The Two-Way Irma Weakens But Continues To Batter Florida The Two-Way Hurricane Irma Blasts Into The Record Books With Lasting Intensity Emergency managers mostly order hurricane evacuations for water, not wind. In Florida, the biggest concern is storm surge. Disaster experts say rapidly rising water poses a much greater threat to property and lives than high winds. But with Hurricane Irma, researcher Jason Senkbeil says many evacuees held a different view. Days before it approached Florida, while it was still in the Caribbean, news reports focused on Irma's intensity and high wind speeds. Senkbeil, a meteorologist at the University of Alabama, studies how emergency managers communicate risk in hurricanes. During the Irma evacuation, he interviewed people at rest stops on Florida's interstates. Many said that when they made the decision to evacuate, Irma was still a Category 4 or 5 hurricane. By the time it hit the Florida mainland, Irma was downgraded to a Category 3 storm and quickly lost intensity, bringing tropical storm force winds to much of the state. Clearly, it could have been worse. The Two-Way Gas In The Tank, Cafecito In Hand: Floridians Prepare For Irma But Bill Johnson worries that unclear messaging led people in safe areas to evacuate their homes. Evacuations carry their own danger of traffic accidents and health problems related to increased stress. Also, they're costly. And unnecessary evacuations tie up scarce resources. The National Hurricane Center is introducing new ways to show when and where strong winds will arrive for specific areas within a forecast cone. Johnson says those tools will help emergency managers encourage those who need to evacuate to do so early and to tell those who don't need to evacuate that their best course is to stay put and shelter in place."}

Irma was packing 185 mph winds and gusts of more than 200 mph as of 2 a.m. ET Wednesday, and is expected to continue churning with deadly hurricane-force winds and a dangerous storm surge across a wide swath of the Caribbean this week before moving toward southern Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The dangerous storm made landfall in Barbuda around 2 a.m. on Wednesday and is moving west-northwest at 15 mph. Hurricane watches and warnings have been issued across Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Turks and Caicos, Cuba and the Leeward Islands. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Jose has formed over the open Atlantic, following closely behind Irma, the NHC said Tuesday. Jose could become a Category 2 hurricane as it brushes the northeastern-most Caribbean islands at the end of the week. However, Jose poses no threat to the U.S. or Puerto Rico as of Tuesday. NOAA A graphic from the National Hurricane Center shows Tropical Storm Jose forming behind Hurricane Irma, Sept. 5, 2017. The NHC on Tuesday called Irma the strongest hurricane in the Atlantic basin outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico in NHC records. By Sunday around 8 a.m., outer bands from Hurricane Irma are expected to reach the Florida Keys with winds of 145 mph as a Category 4 hurricane. Irma's center is forecast to move over Key West on Sunday afternoon. It is still unclear whether the storm will track up the east or west coast of Florida. If Irma travels up Florida's west coast, it would present worst-case scenarios for Gulf cities from Naples to Tampa. Mandatory evacuation orders have been ordered for Monroe County, which includes the Florida Keys, beginning on Wednesday, but cars were already streaming out of the region on Tuesday evening. Officials also anticipate evacuation orders for low-lying portions of Miami-Dade County, including Miami Beach, by late Wednesday or early Thursday. President Donald Trump approved Scott's declaration for a pre-landfall emergency for the entire state of Florida, the governor said in a press conference Tuesday evening. Scott has deployed 100 members of the Florida National Guard, and nearly 7,000 troops will be reporting for duty in the coming days, the governor said. The American Red Cross is sending 1,000 volunteers to Florida, Scott said. The Monroe County School District is shuttering schools Wednesday, the county added. Schools in several other Florida counties, including Miami-Dade and Broward, will be closed Thursday and Friday, Scott said. The University of Miami has canceled classes for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, the school announced Tuesday. There were long lines for gas in many areas of south Florida on Tuesday. All 67 state offices will be closed Friday in preparation for the hurricane, Scott said, encouraging state employees to volunteer at local shelters. The Florida Keys experienced massive flooding from Hurricane Wilma in 2005, which was a Category 3 storm. The last Category 5 storm to make landfall in the Florida Keys was the Labor Day hurricane of 1935. The last time the base was evacuated was in September 2008 for Hurricane Ike. Broward County, Florida Mayor Barbara Sharief said Tuesday that Broward County will feel tropical storm-level winds by Friday. The mayor said those who live in an evacuation zone should plan to evacuate, adding that extra shelters will be available. Schools in Broward County will be closed Thursday and Friday. Category 5 is the strongest hurricane category on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane strength scale.

Four shelters were scheduled to be opened as of Tuesday afternoon. The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico are forecast to see deteriorating conditions throughout the day on Wednesday with the worst of the rain and wind arriving Wednesday night. The storm is expected to pass north of Puerto Rico Wednesday night into early Thursday morning. In Puerto Rico, a state of emergency has been declared, activating the National Guard as the U.S. territory prepares the storm, which the governor on Tuesday called unprecedented. Rossello warned that emergency services will stop when winds reach 50 mph. Shelters are being opened in preparation for the storm, and the governor said all those who have vulnerable homes or flood prone areas need to start evacuation plans and head to shelters.

Thomson Reuters Hurricane Irma made landfall in the Florida Keys on Sunday morning as a Category 4 storm and battered Florida into Monday morning. Irma is now a tropical storm, but it's still producing strong winds and storm-surge flooding. After pummeling the Keys, the storm moved up the west coast of Florida, heading for Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama. Irma hit several Caribbean islands as a Category 5 storm last week, killing at least 41 people. Tropical Storm Irma, which hit Florida as a major hurricane on Sunday, has finally crossed the state line and is now slamming Georgia with powerful winds. The storm is causing record flooding in certain cities because of rainfall and dangerous storm surges. Irma ravaged the west coast of Florida and brought storm-surge flooding, tornadoes, and forceful wind gusts across the state. On Monday morning, it was classified as a tropical storm, according to the National Hurricane Center. But the NHC's latest update says the storm is still producing 50-mph winds with higher gusts, as well as life-threatening storm surges. Irma made landfall at Cudjoe Key in the Florida Keys at 9:10 a.m. ET on Sunday, marking the first time in recorded history that two Category 4 storms have made landfall in the US in the same year. After pummeling the Keys, the storm made landfall on the state's peninsula in Marco Island at 3:35 p.m. ET. The police department there reported a 130-mph wind gust. Irma has since been moving north up Florida's Gulf Coast. Tropical-storm warnings have been discontinued in Florida, but now areas north of Altamaha Sound in Georgia to the South Santee River in South Carolina are under warnings. Record flooding is expected to hit Savannah, Georgia, on Monday. Storm-surge warnings are still in effect from north of Fernandina Beach in Florida to the South Santee River, and on Florida's west coast from north of Clearwater Beach to the Aucilla River. NOAA Irma's effects in the South Irma arrived in Georgia on Sunday after steamrolling several Caribbean islands and leaving at least 41 people dead. In Havana, waves crested 36 feet on Sunday, forcing Cubans and tourists to evacuate inland. Predictive models initially suggested that the storm was heading straight for Miami, but Irma took a westward turn that helped that city avoid the brunt of the storm. The hurricane was big and powerful enough to affect most of Florida, however, including parts that didn't come near the eye. Early reports indicate at least five people died as a result of the storm in Florida. Nearly 6 million homes and businesses had lost power in the state as of Monday afternoon, and another 720,000 were without power in Georgia. That storm surge caused severe flooding in Jacksonville, Fort Myers, and other cities. Streets in Miami were also flooded, and high winds caused a massive crane to collapse onto a building there as well. Irma passed over some of the warmest water it has encountered before making landfall in Florida, which helped it maintain its intensity. The storm regained strength to become a Category 4 hurricane for part of the day Sunday, but its current wind speeds are hovering at around 50 mph. On Saturday, Irma began spinning funnel clouds near South Florida, prompting at least one tornado to touch ground in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Oakland Park, according to the National Weather Service. There were reports of several other tornadoes, and a few more are still possible across northeast Florida, parts of Georgia, and South Carolina through Monday night. Recently planted palm trees are strewn across the road as Hurricane Irma passes by Miami on Sunday. By Sunday morning, that number had reached 114,000 people in 500 shelters statewide. Scott urged evacuees to be patient and not return to their homes until local officials confirm it is safe to do so. The NHC's latest forecast for Irma suggests storm will hit Georgia and the Carolinas with heavy rain on Monday and head into Alabama on Tuesday. Irma's intensity Irma is one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history. At its strongest, the storm's wind speeds hovered around 185 mph, with gusts of more than 215 mph. Initial damage from the storm was observed on Wednesday in Barbuda, an island east of Puerto Rico. Communication with the island was cut off because of the destruction. Barbuda officials worked to evacuate the entire population of 1,800 on Friday amid the threat of Hurricane Jose, though Jose's eye did not end up hitting the island directly.

Winds were still strong enough to cut off power to half of Puerto Rico's residents, however, and reports suggest some may not regain electricity for months. As seen with Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall late last month as a Category 4 hurricane but caused most of its damage with heavy rain, the number doesn't always accurately predict a storm's impact. Preparing for a monster storm Irma formed off the coast of western Africa last week and almost immediately started crossing the Caribbean Sea. It officially became a named storm on August 30 and was classified as a hurricane the next day. The moisture of unusually warm waters in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea allowed the storm to maintain its size and wind speeds for many days. Its sustained wind speeds of 185 mph for 37 hours set a record for the longest a cyclone has maintained that intensity. Here's how Irma compares with other major hurricanes. Reuters In the days before Irma hit the US, officials urged people in Florida and South Carolina to ready their emergency plans and supplies. In total, 7 million people were told to evacuate, leading to traffic jams and fuel shortages across the states. Scott last week ordered all 7,000 members of Florida's National Guard to report for duty on Friday morning. Trump declared states of emergency in Florida, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands on Tuesday evening to free up federal resources to respond to the storm. But a larger population of elderly residents in the state complicated evacuation efforts, overwhelming shelters. Klotzbach said that half of a season's cyclone energy usually occurs in September. But as of Wednesday, there had already been enough to meet the definition of an average season. Both Colorado State University and The Weather Company predicted an unusually active hurricane season this year. Irma is the fourth hurricane of 2017, though the average date of the fourth hurricane in a year is September 21. Katia made landfall in Mexico late Friday night.

Nearly 30 years ago, Puerto Rico was hit hard by Hurricane Hugo, which left more than 28,000 residents homeless. But Abigail Acevedo, 60, who survived Hugo, said Irma was worse. The Puerto Rico electric company said nearly 300,000 people had lost power by early Wednesday afternoon. More than 4,000 had lost water service, mostly because of power failures. The governor has asked the Defense Department to activate the Army National Guard for recovery efforts once the storm passes. The hurricane could hardly have come at a worse time for the territory, which is in the throes of an economic crisis and does not have money for rebuilding. It is unclear whether that property was damaged. OPEN Map The situation on St. Martin was similar: There was no power, the fire station was flooded, and the police station no longer had a roof.

Most projections have Irma slamming into the state by Sunday, although it is unclear where it might make landfall. My team, which has done, and is doing, such a good job in Texas, is already in Florida. Gov. Rick Scott activated the state National Guard and declared a state of emergency across Florida. At a news conference, he urged residents to heed evacuation advisories and to act while the storm is still days away. Irma, he said, is more powerful and dangerous than Andrew. This storm has the potential to devastate the state. The governor said 1,000 National Guard troops would be on duty by Wednesday night, and ordered most state government offices closed on Friday. He urged people to stock up on basics and refill their prescriptions, and said the state was working to address shortages of fuel and bottled water.

Florida left drenched Matthew battered the coast of east-central and northeastern Florida on Saturday, leaving swaths of damage. Water from the storm rushed through streets, making roadways look more like rivers, in parts of Jacksonville, Merritt Island, Fleming Island and other Florida communities. Florida struggled with the rising water, rain and strong winds as meteorologists said the storm surge had been measured at more than 4 feet in some areas. Jacksonville was not battered as heavily as initially feared. But several communities nearby received extensive damage with water surging down some streets, and massive trees toppled over.

{"URL":"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-florida-hurricane-irma-20170907-story.html","Timestamp":"20180819001644","Sentences":"Hurricane Irma took aim at South Florida on Thursday, threatening millions with historic winds, huge storm surges and unrelenting rainfall as it left behind a trail of still-uncharted devastation in the Caribbean and a death toll that climbed to at least 13. As the monster Category 5 storm tracked west-northwest with 175-mph winds, the caprices of wind and water saved impoverished Haiti and the Dominican Republic from a direct hit. But Irma bore down late Thursday on other Caribbean targets: the low-lying Turks and Caicos, and parts of the Bahamas. The hurricane has left a string of small, devastated Caribbean islands counting their dead and struggling to restore links to the outside world. Chaotic conditions hampered efforts to compile a fatality toll, which officials said reached at least 13 and would probably grow. Three people died in the U.S. Virgin Islands and three more in Puerto Rico, their respective governors said, and the Netherlands government confirmed a fatality in St. Maarten, the shattered Dutch side of the island it shares with St. Martin, a French territory. French officials, however, revised downward from eight to four the number of people confirmed dead on the French side. As the storm passed Puerto Rico, it dealt the U.S. territory what was in meteorological terms a glancing blow, but one that landed like a stunning punch, exacerbated by already faltering infrastructure. The governor, Ricardo Rossello, reported that a million people were left without power, and the National Weather Service in San Juan warned of flash-flooding danger from swollen rivers. Irma's howling winds weakened slightly to 175 mph as the eye passed to the north of the Dominican Republic and Haiti. But even a sideswipe by such a intense storm carried devastating power. Hispaniola, the island the two countries share, was lashed by gales and torrential rains. In the north of Haiti, where a hurricane last year killed some 900 people, many learned of government evacuation orders only from neighbors or relatives. Frightened people in the country's north cut branches from trees to try to shore up roofs, said Mishelle Mitchell of the humanitarian group World Vision, who was in the capital, Port-au-Prince. Heavy rain and 185-mph winds lashed the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico's northeast coast. But Scott, in a televised public briefing, pleaded with any holdouts in evacuation zones, especially in the Florida Keys, to obey orders to depart. The Keys, where a mandatory evacuation order was in place, were emptying, with 31,000 people having departed as of Thursday morning, Scott said. An advisory evacuation was in place in Miami-Dade, the state's most populous county, and the order was mandatory in low-lying areas. The expanded evacuation zone, now encompassing about 700,000 people, covers downtown Miami and other parts of the city, plus southern parts of Miami-Dade County. It also included Homestead, Coral Gables, South Miami, Miami Shores and North Miami Beach, authorities said. In Miami Beach, jogger Andrea Ratkovic, 51, was preparing to head home to Oklahoma after the storm scrapped a planned trip to Barbados. First, though, she took a break from her run to help a sandbag-filling crew. While the storm's track remained uncertain, a widening area braced for its effects. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper issued a statewide emergency declaration on Thursday, a day after South Carolina did so. President Trump was briefed in the Oval Office about storm preparations and Irma's projected path. As Thursday dawned, daylight harshly illuminated the storm's destructive rampage through the hardest-hit eastern Caribbean islands, many with colonial links to Western European countries. Boats were tossed onto land. Electrical wires dangled. Streets had turned to rivers. Structures were splintered, with doors and shutters leaning at crazy angles. A Dutch warship has arrived at St. Maarten, the Netherlands' military said. The Dutch interior minister, Ronald Plasterk, who confirmed at least one death, said there could be more casualties. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte earlier said preliminary assessments had painted a bleak picture of the storm's aftermath. Britain was dispatching two warships and hundreds of troops to aid people in its territories, including the British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos. Macron, on an official trip to Greece, said he would visit the hurricane-ravaged French territories as soon as weather permitted. Those covered by a hurricane watch include some of the same islands battered by Irma. He said he was OK with the wind but that at 3:30 in the morning the water started to rise.

{"URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/16/how-the-guardian-reported-the-arrival-and-devastation-of-hurricane-irma","Timestamp":"20180819002126","Sentences":"Other times, we can watch them building from a distance until they fill our entire field of vision, hoping that the plans we put in place actually come together in the moment. Hurricane Irma, barrelling through the Caribbean at upwards of 185mph arrived with plenty of warning, but still, no less unpredictability. Moving and equipping journalists on the ground is expensive and not done lightly, but after a number of days watching the skies, it became clear we should mobilise. As millions were heading north fleeing Florida, our journalists were heading the other way. Breaking off from reporting, he boarded up his home, and made plans for his family to shelter safely. Shelter for us consists of four of us, including my two sons aged 10 and eight, squeezing into a 5ft x 5ft interior closet with no windows, away from exterior walls and doors. My youngest has his teddy bear and some chicken nuggets for comfort. The fact a tornado has actually struck nearby, instead of there just being the possibility of one, is sobering. The family survived a sleepless night and as Miami dodged the eye of the a storm, Richard carried on reporting through the week. Our US chief reporter, Ed Pilkington, has covered most that the world can throw at a journalist, but had not experienced a hurricane first hand. Stocking up on airport sandwiches, he got ready on Friday in his hotel near Miami international airport, for the deluge to come. By Friday afternoon, fuel for the car was his nagging worry as he reported on the tale of two Irmas, in which poor Miami residents stayed behind while the wealthy quit town. By Saturday, weather forecasts suggested the storm was moving west and Ed made the call to drive 100 miles across the state to Naples on the Gulf coast of Florida. A hair-raising drive followed as rains blew sideways and trees littered the deserted highway. When the hurricane reached Florida a day later, Ed was providing words, pictures and video for our live blog and via Twitter. When the storm threatened, they hunkered down. Words and pictures are not the only ways to tell stories today. Josh Holder, who is a developer who makes interactive online stories as part of the Guardian visuals team in London, worked with three other colleagues harnessing technology to show the storm in real time. We decided to add context around the severity of the storm, how well equipped countries were to cope and how it compared to recent storms in the area. Roofs had been torn off, sour seawater had invaded homes and there was no food or water reaching the chain of islands linked to the US mainland by the improbable bridges of highway one. By midweek, with information still only coming in fits and starts from the Caribbean, we ran a report on the catastrophic situation in Havana and Caroline Davies made her way to the British Virgin Islands, the heart of controversy over the preparedness and response of the British government. Even as the death toll rose to 12 in Florida, bringing the total from Irma to 55, the full devastation in the islands is still to become clear. As for the apparent increase in severity of extreme weather events, one key aspect of the way we told the story of hurricanes Irma and Harvey was our decision to grapple with the causes, while others were shy to talk about climate change. Oliver Milman, our New York-based environment correspondent, has examined not only how scientists have warned that higher temperatures have contributed to the severity of tropical storms, but he has also highlighted the consequences of planning failures which have left cities vulnerable to inundation. So Guardian journalists on three continents, using words, pictures and video, processing official and unofficial accounts, brought the deadly power of the hurricane to millions of readers around the world. Hardly. You can never have too many people on the ground witnessing events for themselves and it is, unfortunately, true that more focus goes on those places which are more developed, and easiest to reach and communicate with. Then the lessons to be drawn and vigilance required for reporting on the aftermath are tested, as attention wanders for both audience and newsroom. Even in a dysfunctional seat of government such as Washington DC, billions in aid is unlocked rapidly for national disasters. The restoration of Florida will surely be taken up with greater urgency than restoring the effects of a trail of devastation in the Caribbean."}
