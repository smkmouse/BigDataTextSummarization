Patricia and her husband Ron fled their home in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and sought shelter in Lumberton, only to have their car get caught in the floodwaters. Health authorities have warned that Hurricane Matthew has created conditions that are likely to cause an increase in the deadly waterborne cholera virus.

Hurricane Matthew roared into the southwestern coast of the island of Hispaniola with devastating storm conditions as it headed north toward Cuba and the eastern coast of Florida. As the Category 4 hurricane creeps closer, Cuba, in the likely path of destruction, ordered the evacuation of more than 250,000 people from the east of the island. Hurricane Matthew took aim at densely populated Haiti and Jamaica on Monday, packing winds that could sweep away flimsy buildings and bringing torrential rain that could trigger deadly landslides and floods.

Ghastly photos and videos from St. Martin and St. Barthelemy, also known as St. Barts, showed buildings in ruin and cars and trucks almost submerged in the storm surge. Antigua remains under hurricane watch. Jose is expected to gradually weaken after that, forecasters said. When Craig Ryan, a 29-year-old tourism entrepreneur who lives in Antigua, reached Barbuda by boat, people lined the beach waiting for rescue. There's no electricity, no running water, no communication system, he said. Like that. No buildings, all the roofs gone, concrete ripped in half. Four occurred in the U.S. Virgin Islands, four more in the British Virgin Islands and one apiece on Barbuda and Anguilla. Witnesses said supermarkets were being looted before security personnel were moved in from nearby Guadeloupe. Schaede picked his way through the rubble-filled side streets of Cole Bay, trying to absorb the scale of the destruction on St. Martin.

President Trump owns an 11-bedroom beachfront estate on St. Martin, perched on the sands of Plum Bay. But Schaede said that he has heard that other homes in the neighborhood were severely damaged. Schaede rode out the storm inside a bathroom in a concrete building with his five children. All are safe. His building has a generator that gets turned on only at night, to ration gas.

Nearly 25,000 people have already lost power across the state as of Saturday morning. About 5.6 million people in Florida and 540,000 in Georgia have been ordered to evacuate. Floridians are familiar with ominous forecasts and hurricane warnings, and many have painful memories of Hurricane Andrew, which made landfall as a Category 5 monster in 1992, and other storms that brought lashing rain and winds. But when asked about people in South Florida who intend to ride out the storm at home, Long was blunt. Mark DeMaria, acting deputy director of the hurricane center, said Friday afternoon that the latest models showed the storm track shifting slightly to the west, putting southwest Florida in particular jeopardy for the most violent winds, while all of South Florida will have significant impacts. In addition to having intense power, Irma also is an immense storm, with forecasters reporting hurricane-force winds extending some 70 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extending as far as 195 miles out. Publix, a grocery-store chain, announced plans to close stores across the state in waves and did not say when they would reopen.

Bahamas Bracing for Hurricane Matthew Residents in the Bahamas were bracing for Hurricane Matthew Wednesday. NBC 6's Jamie Guirola reports from Nassau. As of 2 a.m. ET, Matthew was heading northwest and maintained the earlier speed at 10 mph with top sustained winds of 115 mph, having weakend slightly since daytime. Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said Wednesday there is a 25 percent chance of the county getting hurricane force winds, but no evacuations were planned at the moment. A tropical storm warning was in effect for the Florida Keys from Seven Mile Bridge eastward. At least 25 deaths had been blamed on the powerful storm during its weeklong march across the Caribbean, 19 of them in Haiti. The mayor of Petit Goave, a coastal community west of the capital Port-au-Prince, told NBC News 14 people had died there, and the country's Civil Agency has confirmed five people dead with another missing. Two days after the hurricane rampaged across Haiti's remote southwestern peninsula with roaring winds and flooding rains, local authorities and international aid workers still lack a clear picture of the storm's destruction. Dramatic Images From Hurricane Matthew AP But the weather began calming Wednesday and a way was found around a key bridge that was washed away, allowing convoys and helicopters to start ventruing to marooned corners to assess the damage and determine how to help thousands of people who lost homes, livestock and crops.

Scott urged coastal residents to prepare for the possibility of a direct hit and line up three days' worth of food, water and medicine. The White House said relief supplies were being moved to emergency staging areas in the Southeast. The slow-moving storm was expected to drench the coast from the Florida Keys through central Florida, bring storm surge up to 5 feet deep along the Atlantic coast and possibly spawn tornadoes.

VideoHurricane Matthew Quiets Campaign Ahead of Debate Matthew was at one point a Category 5 storm, making it the most powerful hurricane in the region in nearly a decade. It blew ashore around dawn Tuesday in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and a place where many people live in shacks of wood or concrete blocks. In Haiti, where international aid efforts were stymied Tuesday because of the lack of access to the hardest-hit areas, many residents of flooded areas seen by Associated Press reporters were wading through shin-high waters. Muddy rivers and tributaries continued to rise as water flowed down hillsides and mountains, making more flash floods and mudslides possible even as Matthew tracked away from the country.

The fourth hurricane of 2017, Irma, is now a Category 5 storm, and is heading towards the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. Although it's not yet known whether Irma will make landfall in the continental US, officials in the Florida Keys are already issuing evacuation recommendations and closing schools. The storm comes on the heels of Hurricane Harvey, which devastated parts of Texas, including Houston. Irma is already the fourth hurricane of 2017. The peak of the season is around September 10, which means more hurricanes are likely. On Tuesday, a tropical storm named Jose formed in the Atlantic east of Irma, though it's too early to say where it will go. The prevalence and severity of storms so far this year caught many people by surprise, however, and has left many others scrambling to prepare. If you're wondering what to do in the face of hurricane threats, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have resources to help people get ready. Here are some of their recommendations. Miguel Juarez, right, offers free water to passing vehicles Sunday, Aug. 27, 2017, in Rockport, Texas. Since grocery stores empty out and prices get gouged in an emergency situation, stocking up ahead of time is best. Here are FEMA's full e mergency supply list guidelines. Louis Naro waits with his family for a visit from Vice President Mike Pence, Thursday, Aug. 31, 2017, in Rockport, Texas, an area that received heavy damage from Hurricane Harvey. This plan should include packing your emergency supply kit and go-bag. Additionally, you should pick an out-of-state contact that everyone will get in touch with in the event that your family gets separated. Each person should carry a sheet in their wallet with that person's contact information, as well as other important numbers and information. In an ideal scenario, families should practice these plans ahead of time to work out any kinks and gain comfort with them before encountering stressful conditions. To keep track of a developing storm, you can also sign up for alerts from the National Weather Service (NWS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Residents wait at a high school gym before they are evacuated as the outer bands of Hurricane Harvey begin to make landfall, Friday, Aug. 25, 2017, in Corpus Christi, Texas. If you live in an area that could face such a threat, make an evacuation plan with your family that includes which roads you'll take and where you'll go. Generally, emergency shelters are set up in the days ahead of a storm, so you can consult FEMA or your local city government to determine where those will be. However, some cities have good reason to avoid issuing evacuation orders. When Harvey hit Houston, officials didn't tell residents to leave in order to avoid clogging highways and other roads. Those drivers could have found themselves getting into accidents or stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic as waters overtook roadways. When Hurricane Rita barreled toward Texas in 2005, an exodus of about 3 million people contributed to at least 73 deaths before the storm arrived. So if there's no voluntary or mandatory evacuation in place for your area, stay put and keep your car in good working condition with a full gas tank in case a late evacuation order does come. Once a mandatory evacuation is put in place, however, you should leave immediately. That's why it's important to have a go-bag prepared. Wires are exposed after a traffic signal was snapped by the winds of Hurricane Harvey in downtown Corpus Christi, Texas, Saturday, Aug. 26, 2017. Because lighting candles can create a fire risk, flashlights with extra batteries are key. The DHS also recommends that you keep your cell phone fully charged as long as you have electricity. If you're anticipating that power might go out, it's also a good idea to turn your freezer and refrigerator to their coldest settings about 6 hours before a storm hits. That way, food will last longer if the power goes out. You can also move things to the freezer if you won't need them right away. If your house loses power, avoid opening the fridge and freezer doors as much as possible to keep cold air in. Freezing ice packs and preparing coolers to store food can help keep things fresh for longer. It is possible, of course, to buy a portable generator or get one installed if you're planning far ahead. But any generator should be protected from moisture and kept outside, well away from any windows or doors. Because there is also a chance water will be cut off after power has gone out, FEMA recommends filing sinks and bathtubs in order to have extra water to use for flushing toilets or washing. Homes are surrounded by floodwaters from Tropical Storm Harvey Tuesday, Aug. 29, 2017, in Spring, Texas. The simplest is to secure rain gutters to the house and clear clogged areas or drains to prevent water from building up and causing damage. You can also stockpile sand bags, plastic sheeting, and plywood to be used as necessary. If you have time, it's a good idea to unplug appliances, and move any light furniture and valuables to higher floors of your house or building. More costly preparations include installing sump pumps with backup batteries and a water alarm to alert you when the system is getting overloaded. It's also a good idea to waterproof your basement if you live in a flood-prone area, and to elevate your heating system, water heater, and electric panel to heights at which flood waters won't cause damage. The most important (though often most difficult) precaution to take is avoiding walking or driving through flood waters. Even 6 inches of fast-moving water can knock a person down, and 12 inches can sweep away a car. The water can also hide dangerous debris and make it hard to tell where the ground has washed away. Plus, there's a risk of electricity from downed power lines, contamination from sewage and other chemicals, and wildlife like snakes and fire ants trying to escape. A tree is seen knocked sideways during the passing of Hurricane Harvey on August 26, 2017 in Corpus Christi, Texas. Irma is currently a Category 5 storm, which means its wind speeds are at least 157 mph. But there's no category above 5, which makes it hard to differentiate between the most severe hurricanes. When heavy winds arrive, stay away from windows, since fast-moving debris could break the glass and fly into the house. FEMA recommends seeking shelter on the home's lowest level, in an interior room, though a flood risk could change that calculation. If you're bracing for extreme winds, you should also reinforce doors, windows, walls, and roofs as much as possible in advance. Putting tape on windows does not help, however, since it could cause the glass to break into larger, deadlier shards. The DHS recommends bringing any outdoor objects (like patio tables and chairs) inside, and anchoring anything that shouldn't be indoors (like propane tanks). If you have more time to prepare your house, the DHS recommends trimming and removing damaged trees and limbs to minimize the risk of them falling and causing damage or injuries. It may also be a worthwhile long-term investment to retrofit and secure your roof, windows, and doors, or to add storm shutters. A volunteer helps clean up the damage from a Lutheran church in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Harvey in Dickinson, Texas, U.S., September 2, 2017. FEMA suggests waiting for officials to say an area is safe before returning. The agency also recommends avoiding the use of electrical equipment, waiting for a given building to be inspected before entering it, and drinking bottled or boiled water until tap water is declared safe. All food that was exposed to flood water (even if it's in a can or bottle) should be thrown out, as should anything perishable that was not kept at the proper temperature. As far as insurance is concerned, it's best to take as many photos as possible of the initial damage, and to do what you can to prevent further damage (covering ceiling holes with tarps, for example) since insurance plans might not cover the losses sustained after a storm.

Tampa dodged Irma's worst, but the city is still at risk and unprepared for major hurricanes Tamara Lush , Associated Press Sep. 13, 2017, 8:37 AM ST. createPerformanceMark('first image displayed'); A man walks past a fallen tree along Bayshore Blvd in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma in Tampa, Florida on September 11, 2017. There was good reason to worry. Since 1921, when about 120,000 people lived there, the region has added 3 million residents and tens of thousands of new homes along low-lying waterfront property. The storm left Tampa and St. Petersburg with only power outages and downed tree limbs to contend with. Study after study has shown the Tampa region is among the world's most vulnerable when it comes to major storms. Yet so far it has failed to take some key precautions, such as burying power lines, ending the practice of filling and building in wetlands and putting brakes on residential development. Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn told an AP reporter Sunday morning that he expected his Davis Islands home to flood and was bracing for 5 to 8 feet of storm surge. By Monday, his tone was giddily cheerful, after his city and home weren't destroyed as predicted. We can't go another 90 years without a direct hit. We came close last night. Initially, there were two small islands, but an enterprising developer in the 1920s dredged the bay and filled them in with mud, then planned a resort-like community with lavish Mediterranean-style homes. A home damaged by a tree is seen after Hurricane Irma made landfall in Tampa, Florida on September 11, 2017. It's where baseball player Derek Jeter lives in a 30,000-square foot waterfront home. Also on the island: Tampa General Hospital. To be sure, Tampa General says it has a plan for storms and can withstand them. But recent storms, such as Irma and even Harvey in Texas, make policymakers wonder what more can be done now that the area's packed with people and infrastructure. Buckhorn, a Democrat, says that while he's not willing to blame Irma on climate change, he believes a serious discussion about climate change and rising seas must happen soon. None of that I can change. A 2013 World Bank study that ranked cities according to their vulnerability to major storms placed Tampa at number seven among all cities in the world. A report released in June by CoreLogic, a global property information firm, said nearly 455,000 Tampa Bay homes could be damaged by hurricane storm surges, the most in any major U.S. metro area except Miami and New York City. The Tampa skyline on September 10, not long before Irma reached it. Reuters In 2016, the risk-management consultancy Karen Clark & Co. said Tampa Bay is the nation's most vulnerable metro area to storm surge flooding caused by a once-in-century hurricane. And that's what was forecast for a several-hour spell Sunday morning: catastrophic storm surges, hours of 130 mph winds and massive destruction.

For the first time in 85 years, Puerto Rico is expected to suffer a direct landfall from such a strong hurricane. In Antigua, another island battered by Irma, yacht skipper Kevin Joseph took extra precautions ahead of Maria. Now those evacuees and native Puerto Ricans are bracing for another catastrophic hurricane. Puerto Rico housing authorities said there are 450 shelters able to take in 62,714 evacuees, and up to 125,428 in an emergency situation. But there are six fewer shelters available post-Irma, since some schools still have no electricity. What to expect from Maria The storm will affect parts of the Leeward Islands and the British and US Virgin Islands for next couple of days, the center said. Other Leeward Islands are now under hurricane warnings, including Guadeloupe, Dominica, St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat. The US Virgin Islands and the British Virgin Islands are under warnings. Trump issued an emergency declaration for the US Virgin Islands. There are tropical storm warnings in effect for Antigua and Barbuda, Saba and St. Eustatius, St. Martin, Anguilla and St. Lucia.

The National Hurricane Center on Thursday issued a hurricane watch for the southernmost part of Florida, the first such alert Irma has prompted in the continental United States. A storm surge watch, which warned of potentially life-threatening levels of water, was also issued for the southern part of the state, an area that includes the Florida Keys, which a day earlier had begun evacuations. With potentially millions of people hitting the road to escape, Scott said emergency efforts were underway to keep fuel shipments moving to gas stations. Increasing evacuations were getting underway across South Florida. On Thursday, Broward County began to evacuate people from the area along the Atlantic. Miami-Dade County, which had announced evacuations on Wednesday, expanded the order on Thursday to include more people across the coastal portion of the county. In Naples, Fla., a Best Buy opened on Thursday morning to about two dozen shoppers waiting outside.

Haiti raised its hurricane alert level to red, its highest, and the north coast remained under a hurricane watch as the central coast faced the threat of tropical storm winds and rain. Nevertheless, aid groups said the national hurricane response appeared to be slow. Many evacuations in the north were set to unfold as rains rapidly approached and low-quality shelters were still being finished. School was canceled across the country as national warnings went out through social media, radio and television. In some remote towns, word to take shelter was being spread largely via local officials with bullhorns. One major concern was the spread of a cholera outbreak already plaguing Haiti.

That storm, along with the recent devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey in Texas, has lingered in the background of the urgent warnings issued by Florida officials. States of emergency were also declared in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. On Thursday, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R) expanded his declaration from six coastal counties to 30 total counties, issuing a mandatory evacuation for some areas. Officials across Florida responded to the alarming forecasts by slowly shutting down the contours of daily life. Schools closed across the state, including the University of Central Florida in Orlando, which could face punishing weather if Irma crawls up the coastline.

The latter, currently moving across Florida, is the strongest sustained hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane strength is measured on the Saffir-Simpson scale, ranging from one (the lowest) to five (the highest) based on the hurricane's wind speed and estimated potential damage. This takes into account parameters such as whether the hurricane uproots trees or removes roofs from houses, and whether the destruction could last for days or months. Initially, Hurricane Irma was rated as a category five (it is now losing energy), with winds moving at 175 mph - destroying homes and causing power failure in the Caribbean. Climate change People have been quick to ask if Hurricane Irma is connected to climate change and whether this is a sign of things to come. It remains uncertain whether hurricanes have significantly increased in frequency or severity as global temperatures have risen, partly due to a lack of long-term data. We know that hurricane formation is affected by changes in sea surface temperatures - a warm ocean helps fuel hurricanes. This is partly driven by natural periodic and cyclic variations in the Earth's climatic and oceanic systems, meaning that in some years the ocean is warmer than in others. Studies have presented mixed views of what will happen in the future with global warming. However, there are many consistent models and research articles indicating that there will be fewer hurricanes along the Atlantic coast, but that those that do form will be more severe- due to the warmer temperatures. However, it's important to keep in mind that what we've seen recently, compared with decades ago, is not so much a change in hurricanes, but a change in impacts. Many coasts have become increasingly urbanized, and this trend is likely to continue. As with many small islands, much of the population of Barbuda, Guadeloupe and others in the Caribbean are situated on the narrow coastal fringe - meaning they experience the full force of natural disasters, sometimes on scales never seen before. This means there is more infrastructure to be destroyed or damaged during extreme weather conditions than say to 100 years ago. The same can be said as Irma moves over Florida. Waves crash against the Havana seafront boulevard El Malecon ahead of Hurricane Irma. Thomson Reuters Vulnerable economies Infrastructure on islands, such as harbors and airports, are key lifelines to the outside world - and any disruption to these can have serious consequences, potentially for many years. On small islands, infrastructure is partly there to support the economy (including tourism), which in turn provides further economic development, social welfare and health benefits to the wider population. Take the infrastructure away as Irma has, and the economy declines leading to a shock. This is because, historically, small islands have been essential maritime or colonial hubs or trading posts. But today they are highly reliant on external trade, often through fisheries, agriculture or tourism. Concentrating on one or two industries makes islands strong, but when extreme events or global disasters occur, the shock means they count the cost. Essentially, they have their eggs all in one basket. Hurricane Andrew, also a category five event, made landfall in August 1992 - affecting the Bahamas and Florida. Luckily, advertising campaigns and repairs ultimately prevented the loss in tourist revenue. This is an important lesson about how to respond to such events. Other extreme events have caused long-lived adverse effects. For instance, in the Maldives in the Indian Ocean, the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami affected tourism and wider development for several years. Clearly there is a need for planning in emergency response. This needs to be targeted and accompanied by long-term resilience strategies. Shocks can also provide opportunities. Thanks to the Maldivian Safer Islands programme, islands have been constructed to a higher elevation to reduce the long-term risk of flooding. Irma has reminded the world that extra help is needed when an island state is partially destroyed. Storm damage after Hurricane Irma is shown in Tortola, part of the British Virgin Islands, on Sept. 7, 2017. In addition to warming temperatures and potential increase in future severity, the slow, but long-term effects of sea-level rise could also increase the extent of flood impacts during and after extreme events. From 1901 to 2010, sea levels rose by about 1.9 millimeters a year. This is projected to accelerate, so that sea-levels are about a metre higher in 2100 than today. Over a century, sea-level rise could make the difference between minor and major flooding, and the longevity of impacts. Indeed, long-lasting impacts may provide impetus for introducing a category six of the Saffir-Simpson scale. This could describe cases that have a permanent effect on living conditions - potentially making some areas permanently uninhabitable. Such effects are currently not accounted for on the scale. Whether we do introduce a new category remains to be seen, but it is certainly something worth discussing. Adaptation to climate change and extreme events can help to increase resilience and reduce damage in extreme conditions. But due to their shear strength, events such as Hurricane Irma cannot be adapted to. Sadly, humans will never be totally resilient to extreme events and long-lasting impacts remains a major challenge for all. All rights reserved.

Retired NYPD Officer Hailed as Hero For Saving Girl in Aruba Deadly Progress in Caribbean The dangerous Category 4 storm blew ashore around dawn in a corner of Haiti where many people live along the coast in shacks of wood or simple concrete blocks. Two deaths in Haiti were confirmed as of Tuesday afternoon, with four in the Dominican Republic, one in Northeast Colombia and one in the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines islands.But with a key bridge washed out, roads impassable and phone communications down, the western tip of Haiti was isolated and there was no word on dead and injured in that area. Matthew was inflicting major damage, though the extent was not immediately known, said Marie Alta Jean-Baptiste, director of the country's Civil Protection Agency. Many streets were flooded or blocked with fallen trees throughout the southwestern peninsula. Rivers surged with muddy water as heavy rain fell. Local radio reported that the water was shoulder high in parts of Les Cayes, near where Matthew came ashore. Milriste Nelson, a 65-year-old farmer in the town of Leogane, said his neighbors fled when the wind ripped the corrugated metal roof from their home.

Some sought shelter only after the worst was already upon them, making their way through debris-strewn streets amid pounding rain. Matthew was expected to bring 15 to 25 inches of rain, and up to 40 inches (100 centimeters) in isolated places, along with up to 10 feet (3 meters) of storm surge and battering waves. The storm was moving along the Windward Passage between Haiti and Jamaica, where it was dumping heavy rain that caused flooding. It was headed for southeastern Cuba and then the Bahamas. The center of the storm was projected to pass about 50 miles northeast of the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

ST. Irma regained Category 5 status late Friday, and with its 160 mph (260 kph) winds battering Cuba and taking aim at the Miami metropolitan area of 6 million people, the death toll in the storm's wake across the Caribbean climbed to 22. Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and the eastern part of Cuba reported no major casualties or damage by mid-afternoon after Irma rolled north of the Caribbean's biggest islands.

But many residents and tourists farther east were left reeling after the storm ravaged some of the world's most exclusive tropical playgrounds, known for their turquoise waters and lush green vegetation. Among them: St. Martin, St. Barts, St. Thomas, Barbuda and Anguilla. Irma smashed homes, shops, roads and schools; knocked out power, water and telephone service; trapped thousands of tourists; and stripped trees of their leaves, leaving an eerie, blasted-looking landscape littered with sheet metal and splintered lumber. On Friday, looting and gunshots were reported on St. Martin, and a curfew was imposed in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Many of Irma's victims fled their islands on ferries and fishing boats for fear of Hurricane Jose, a Category 4 storm with 150 mph winds that could punish some places all over again this weekend.

On Barbuda, a coral island rising a mere 125 feet (38 meters) above sea level, authorities ordered an evacuation of all 1,400 people to neighboring Antigua, where Stevet Jeremiah was reunited with one son and made plans to bury another. Jeremiah, who sells lobster and crab to tourists, was huddled in her wooden home on Barbuda early Wednesday with her partner and their 2- and 4-year-old boys as Irma ripped open their metal roof and sent the ocean surging into the house. Her younger son, Carl Junior Francis, was swept away. Neighbors found his body after sunrise. He just turned 2, the 17th, last month. Her first task, she said, would be to organize his funeral. The dead included 11 on St. Martin and St. Barts, four in the U.S. Virgin Islands, four in the British Virgin Islands and one each on Anguilla and Barbuda. Also, a 16-year-old junior professional surfer drowned Tuesday in Barbados while surfing large swells generated by an approaching Irma. Many victims picked through the rubble of what had once been Caribbean dream getaway homes. On St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, power lines and towers were toppled, a water and sewage treatment plant was heavily damaged, and the harbor was in ruins, along with hundreds of homes and dozens of businesses. Opera singer Laura Strickling and her husband, Taylor, moved to St. Thomas three years ago from Washington so he could take a job as a lawyer. They rented a top-floor apartment with a stunning view of the turquoise water of Megan's Bay, which is surrounded by low hills covered by trees. Strickling huddled with her husband and their year-old daughter in a basement apartment along with another family as the storm raged for 12 hours. It was so loud we thought the roof was gone.

Irma threatened to push its way northward from one end of Florida to the other beginning Sunday morning in what many fear could be the long-dreaded, catastrophic Big One. Across Florida and Georgia, more than 6 million people were warned to leave their homes, clogging interstates as far away as Atlanta. At the same time, more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) to the east, authorities commandeered a ferry from Montserrat with room for 350 and began moving people from Barbuda to the larger island of Antigua. The owners of several fishing boats also volunteered to help. On St. Martin, which is divided between Dutch and French control, cafes and shops were swamped, and the storm left gnarled black branches denuded of leaves. Battered cars, corrugated metal, plywood, wrought iron and other debris covered street after street. Roofs were torn off numerous houses. There was little left of St. Martin's Hotel Mercure but its sign, painted on a still-standing wall. The cleanup was already underway for some. One man chopped at the branches of a bare tree. Another heaved what appeared to be furniture stuffing onto a pile. People sat in chairs outside a hospital, waiting to be seen. William Marlin, prime minister of the Dutch side of St. Martin, said recovery was expected to take months even before Jose threatened to make things worse. On St. Thomas, Jodi Jabas and Matt Biwer were combing through the wreckage of the home they had been busy remodeling before the storm. They huddled in a studio apartment on the ground floor as Irma roared overhead. The storm took off the roof and a good section of the house with it. Jalon Shortte said riding out Irma in his top-floor apartment on Tortola, in the British Virgin Islands, was the scariest thing he has ever been through. The air pressure hurt his ears, trees fell on his roof, windows blew out and a door came off, he wrote on Facebook. The storm even took paint off the walls, he said.

Current conditions across the Atlantic basin and beyond portend a favorable environment for tropical cyclone development in the coming months. Sea surface temperature anomalies indicate that not only are the key formation areas warmer than average but also the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) is in a positive phase, which generally enhances tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. Sea surface temperature anomalies analyzed May 31 across the Atlantic basin. &nbsp;The equator is marked with a thick black line for reference. In the Pacific, things are neutral. Sea surface temperatures around the equator are higher than average but not quite enough to meet the criteria. This morning, Colorado State University released a new hurricane season outlook. The team, which is led by Capital Weather Gang expert Phil Klotzbach, is also predicting a slightly above-average season. with 14 named storms, 6 hurricanes, 2 major hurricanes and an accumulated cyclone energy of 99. The climatological average is 12 named storms, 6.5 hurricanes, 2 major hurricanes and an ACE of 92. The group also highlights a few years to which this hurricane appears to be similar: 1957, 1969, 1979 and 2006. The important footnote on these forecasts is that they say nothing about how many storms will make landfall. The storm surge products were experimental for the past two seasons but finally got put through the wringer during hurricanes Hermine and Matthew and were successful and well-received. The NHC product suite has included a wind speed probability swath since 2006, but new this season is the addition of time of arrival lines for the onset of tropical-storm-force winds. The right side of the graphic shows an example of the new track forecast map using Hurricane Sandy from October 2012.

{"Number":"50","Sentences":"Dangerous Hurricane Matthew will bring great risk to lives and property from Haiti and Cuba to the Bahamas this week. Matthew will continue to weave a general northward path around the large islands of the northern Caribbean through Wednesday. The powerful hurricane will pass close to or directly over the western tip of Haiti and the eastern tip of Cuba. In these areas, life-threatening conditions are likely, since the most powerful part of the hurricane will approach. Impacts will range from flooding rainfall and storm surge flooding to mudslides, high winds and dangerous seas and surf into the middle of the week. However, flooding rainfall and mudslides will extend 100 miles or more to the east of the storm over the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola and can occur as far west as Jamaica and central Cuba. Drenching, gusty squalls can occur as far east as Puerto Rico. The latest indications are that Matthew will take more of a northwestward path beginning around Wednesday and continuing through Friday. The Turks and Caicos may also face significant impacts by the hurricane as it passes to their west. The slow-moving nature of the hurricane will translate to days rather than hours of pounding surf, high winds and heavy rain on the islands. More than 20 inches of rain can fall near and east of the center of the storm, especially over mountainous terrain. People are encouraged to make preparations now and heed evacuation orders as they are given. Great disruption to travel will also occur in the region. Cruise, freight and charter airline interests in the region should be prepared to change itineraries until the storm has passed. Commercial airline delays and cancellations are likely as the storm approaches. Many of these areas will be in need of assistance in the wake of the storm. Power may be out for days. Food, fresh water and medical items may be in short supply following the storm. As Matthew turns northwestward across the Bahamas, seas and surf along the coast of the southeastern United States will build and become dangerous later this week.

Hurricane Matthew, the most powerful Atlantic tropical storm in almost a decade, took aim for the Bahamas on Wednesday after it flooded streets, flattened homes and left a trail of destruction in Haiti. Matthew, a powerful storm with sustained winds of 140 mph, made landfall in Haiti just after 7 a.m. (8 a.m. ET) Tuesday. With communications down across much of the island, it remained too early to accurately assess the damage Wednesday morning, but civil defense officials said many homes had been destroyed or damaged in the south. Matthew brushed past the eastern tip of Cuba at about 8 p.m. ET, almost 53 years to the day after Hurricane Flora killed 2,000 Cubans on Oct. 3, 1963, the National Hurricane Center said. Landfall came at Juaco in a remote, sparsely populated part of the island, and preliminary reports indicated that the soaking rains and driving winds caused relatively little damage. High winds from Hurricane Matthew blow trees sideways Tuesday in Baracoa, Cuba. Running into Cuba also did little to weaken Matthew, whose top sustained winds had dipped only to 125 mph by 2 a.m. So far, Haiti's civil protection agency has reported just two deaths, one of them a fisherman who drowned in rough water churned up by the storm. A woman carries a child through the rain triggered Tuesday by Hurricane Matthew in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. But officials fear the death toll could rise, especially in and around the southern town of Les Cayes, which absorbed the first blow from Matthew and where hundreds were hunkering down in homes without electricity and roofs. Kevin Roth, a meteorologist for The Weather Channel, warned that by the time that back end of Matthew clears the island, Matthew could swamp Haiti's low-lying areas with up to 20 inches of rain and dump as much as 40 inches in the mountains.

Tribune news servicesContact Reporter Hurricane Matthew churned toward the Bahamas early Wednesday with a spreading mix of high winds, heavy rains and a dangerous storm surge, leaving widespread damage and human suffering behind in Haiti's poor, rural southwestern peninsula. At least 11 deaths had been blamed on the powerful storm during its weeklong march across the Caribbean, five of them in Haiti. But with a key bridge washed out, roads impassable and phone communications down, the western tip of Haiti was isolated and there was no word on dead and injured. Forecasters said the high winds, pounding rains and storm surge were already beginning to have an impact in the southern Bahamas as the powerful Category 3 hurricane left Haiti and eastern Cuba behind and marched toward the island chain over open waters Wednesday. A day earlier, Matthew swept across a remote area of Haiti with 145 mph winds, and government leaders said they weren't close to fully gauging the impact in the vulnerable, flood-prone country where less powerful storms have killed thousands. The hurricane also had made landfall Tuesday night near Cuba's sparsely populated eastern tip with no immediate reports of major damage. By Wednesday it was moving again over open waters on a forecast path expected to take it very near Florida's Atlantic coast by Thursday evening. At 5 a.m. EDT Matthew's eye was about 65 miles north-northwest of the tip of eastern Cuba. Matthew had top sustained winds of 125 mph and was heading north at 10 mph as it was taking aim at the Bahamas. Oct. 7, 2016.

Tropical storm conditions began spreading over the southeastern Bahamas early Wednesday, with hurricane conditions expected to follow later, the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said. Bahamas Prime Minister Perry Christie voiced concern about the potential impact on the sprawling archipelago off Florida's east coast. The hurricane center said winds had slightly decreased overnight as Matthew dropped from a Category 4 to a still powerful Category 3 storm early Wednesday. But forecasters warned such fluctuations in intensity were expected and that Matthew would remain a powerful and dangerous storm over coming days. There was growing concern on the U.S. East Coast, which was expected to come under threat after Matthew made a two-day surge up the length of the Bahamas. People raced to supermarkets, gas stations and hardware stores, buying up groceries, water, plywood, tarps, batteries and propane. Hurricane Matthew slams Haiti with torrential rain. Oct. 4, 2016.

Rick Scott urged coastal residents to prepare for the possibility of a direct hit and line up three days' worth of food, water and medicine. The White House said relief supplies were being moved to emergency staging areas in the Southeast. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she would issue an evacuation order Wednesday so 1 million people would have time to leave the coast. The Red Cross put out a call for volunteers there. In Haiti, where international aid efforts were stymied Tuesday because of the lack of access to the hardest-hit areas, many residents of flooded areas seen by Associated Press reporters were wading through shin-high waters. Muddy rivers and tributaries continued to rise as water flowed down hillsides and mountains, making more flash floods and mudslides possible even Matthew tracked away from the country. Matthew was at one point a Category 5 storm, making it the most powerful hurricane in the region in nearly a decade. It blew ashore around dawn Tuesday in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and a place where many people live in shacks of wood or concrete blocks. Mourad Wahba, U.N. secretary-general's deputy special representative for Haiti, said at least 10,000 people were in shelters and hospitals were overflowing and running short of water. Surging waters ripped away a bridge in the flooded town of Petit Goave, preventing any road travel to the hard-hit southwest. Local radio reported water shoulder high in parts of the southern city of Les Cayes. Milriste Nelson, a 65-year-old farmer in the town of Leogane, said neighbors fled when the wind tore away the corrugated metal roof on their home. His own small yard was strewn with the fruit he depends on for his livelihood. Haitian authorities had tried to evacuate people from the most vulnerable areas ahead of the storm, but many were reluctant to leave their homes. Some sought shelter only after the worst was already upon them. Rainfall totals were predicted to reach 15 to 25 inches in Haiti, with up to 40 inches in isolated places. OFFICIALS WORRIED ABOUT COMPLACENCY Hurricane Matthew's slog toward the East Coast has government officials worried about complacency, especially in South Florida, which hasn't seen a major hurricane in 11 years. South Carolina's governor said she would issue an evacuation order Wednesday so that 1 million people would have time to leave the coast, and residents up and down the Eastern seaboard flocked to hardware stores, grocery aisles and gas stations to prepare for the powerful storm. A dangerous Category 3 storm with sustained winds of 125 mph, Matthew was bearing down on the southern Bahamas early Wednesday amid forecasters' predictions it would be very near Florida's Atlantic coast by Thursday evening. Already the hurricane was spreading high winds, heavy rain and a dangerous storm surge ahead of it on its approach to the Bahamas, forecasters said. It added that while maximum winds decreased slightly in recent hours, the fluctuation in intensity was expected and some slight strengthening is forecast in coming days. Officials hope to avoid a repeat of Hurricanes Wilma and Katrina, which caused major damage to South Florida in 2005, and Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm, leveled much of the city of Homestead in 1992. Curbelo, a Republican, said he wants assurances that the federal, state and local governments are working together. The Miami forecasters issued a hurricane warning for the area north of Golden Beach near Fort Lauderdale to Sebastian Inlet, meaning hurricane force winds of 74 mph or higher are expected within two days. A hurricane watch is also in effect from Sebastian Inlet to Fernandina Beach, meaning hurricane force winds could occur. During rush hour Tuesday, long lines formed at gas stations in Charleston, South Carolina, snarling traffic as lines snaked out of gas stations and into travel lanes. At one gas station in Mount Pleasant, the line reached about a quarter mile down the street. In South Florida, lines at grocery stores were heavier than usual and some essentials were in short supply. When Simone Corrado and her husband tried to buy water at their Publix in Davie near Fort Lauderdale, they mostly found empty shelves. There were a few bottles of high-end water brands, but there was so much empty shelf space that Corrado lay down and fully stretched out on the bottom shelf. Florida Gov. Rick Scott warned residents they must be prepared to take a direct hit and evacuation orders could be issued as early as Tuesday. Hurricane Hermine became the first to strike Florida since Wilma in 2005 when it hit the eastern Panhandle on Sept. 2 as a Category 1 storm, causing one death, storm surge damage to beachfront homes and downed trees and powerlines. That 11-year lull between storms hitting Florida was the longest on record. The last storm to hit Florida from the Atlantic side was Katrina, which struck on its way to devastating the Gulf coast. It concluded a two-year span when a record eight hurricanes hit the state. Governors in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina declared states of emergency, and the White House said President Barack Obama canceled a campaign and health care events in Florida on Wednesday and would instead visit the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for an update. Some airlines let passengers change travel plans without penalty if their trip might be affected by Matthew. Near Fort Lauderdale, The Home Depot in Davie briefly ran out of propane for gas barbecues and the supply of batteries was dwindling. People bought plywood to cover windows, tarps to put over outdoor furniture and coolers for food storage. Anesthesiologist Darby Lipka lugged a 20-pound propane tank across the parking lot, saying he had already purchased food and water. Haley said state officials would reverse lanes on major evacuation routes in South Carolina. It would be the first major evacuation since Hurricane Floyd in 1999, when the governor at the time didn't reverse the lanes and Interstate 26 became a parking lot.

{"Number":"59","Sentences":"By Jason Samenow , Weather editor Greg Porter September 11, 2017 (This post was updated throughout Sunday and last updated at 8:00 a.m. Extremely dangerous Hurricane Irma first crashed into the Florida Keys on Sunday morning and then made a second landfall on Marco Island on Florida's west coast Sunday afternoon, unleashing violent wind gusts up to 142 mph and storm-surge flooding. As it plowed through northern Florida Monday morning, however, it weakened to a tropical storm. At 8 a.m., the storm was centered 105 miles north-northwest of Tampa. Almost the entire state of Georgia was covered in heavy rain. Dangerous flash flooding due to heavy rain and storm surge was occurring around downtown Jacksonsville. And thanks to Irma's large wind field, a broad area was experiencing tropical-storm force winds and gusts up to hurricane strength. Irma's peak winds of 70 mph make it a strong tropical storm, but much less intense than the Category 4 hurricane it was just one day earlier with 130 mph winds. The National Hurricane Center said Irma is expected to weaken to a tropical depression by Tuesday afternoon. Coastal waters could still rise well above normally dry land along the coast of Florida, Georgia, and southern South Carolina, resulting in areas of flooding. The Weather Service urged affected residents to move to higher ground. The Weather Service reported the storm surge flooding in Jacksonville set an all-time record. Central Florida Irma's eyewall passed on the east side of Sarasota around 10 p.m. and was about 60 miles north of Tampa around 5 a.m., producing wind gusts around 75 mph. Even on Central Florida's east coast, tropical-storm force winds and hurricane-force gusts were fairly widespread Sunday evening. At St. Lucie, a gust reached 99 mph and Cape Canaveral gusted to 79 mph. Southwest Florida The worst winds had passed this region just prior to 9:30 p.m. Sunday but gusty showers continued on the storm's backside. Irma's eyewall passed through Fort Myers and Cape Coral just before 7 p.m., producing wind gusts of 88 and 101 mph and then passed on the west side of Port Charlotte between 8 and 9 p.m. Then the calm eye moved overhead. Aerial video from inside eye of Hurricane Irma. But forecasters warned residents that shortly after the storm's center passed to the north and winds blew back onshore, waters would rush back in rapidly causing severe inundation. In Ft. Myers, waters levels were rising through 10 p.m., but not as dramatically as they had in Naples. Southeast Florida In Southeast Florida, spiral bands continued to unleash tropical-storm-force winds. Even into the evening, winds were gusting up to 60 to 75 mph around Miami and West Palm Beach (7 p.m. gust of 75 mph), but they weren't as strong as earlier. Miami International Airport clocked a gust to 94 mph and an isolated gust hit 100 mph at the University of Miami. Also during the afternoon the seas had risen several feet above normally dry land. Social media photos and videos showed water pouring through Miami's streets, in between high-rises, amid sideways sheets of rains. This is Miami right now. Gusts still reached 50 to 60 mph as of 7:45 p.m. Early Sunday afternoon, the maximum surge at Cudjoe Key was estimated at 10 feet. Statewide About 3.6 million customers were without power. Particularly in South and Central Florida, torrential rain had fallen, with widespread totals of 6 to 10 inches and pockets up to 10 to 14 inches. Numerous flash flood warnings had been issued. Storm warnings in effect and predicted surge height and winds Tropical storm warnings cover much of central and northern Florida (except for the far west panhandle), the entire Georgia coast, and the southern coast of South Carolina. A storm surge warning remained in effect for much of Florida's west coast and northeast coast and extended north along the Georgia coast and southern South Carolina coast. Effects on Florida Conditions will continue to deteriorate Monday over Florida in the north part of the state as Irma plows northward. Conditions will slowly improve to the south. Hazard threats: Rain, tornadoes, wind, surge The northeast portion of Florida will be spared the worst of Irma but won't escape unscathed. Sustained tropical-force winds of 40 to 55 mph will overspread the area from Daytona Beach to Jacksonville by Sunday evening, with the worst winds (gusts up to 70 mph) occurring overnight. As with other parts of the state, the tornado threat will peak overnight on Sunday as Irma's storm center tracks northward. Storm-surge values will be elevated (two to four feet) but should result in only minor to moderate coastal flooding. Hazard threats: Wind, rain and, at the coast, storm surge Hurricane warnings extend well into Georgia, covering over half of the state. Parts of southern South Carolina also are under a hurricane warning, with Irma poised to maintain its hurricane-force strength for several hours after landfall. Sustained tropical force winds of 25 to 45 mph will spread over Georgia from south to north starting late Sunday night. The strongest sustained winds (40 to 50 mph) with gusts of 60-plus mph will move in on early Monday morning, lasting through Monday evening. This includes Atlanta, which is under a tropical-storm warning, where sustained winds of 25 to 40 mph with gusts up to 60 mph will occur from about 10 p.m. Sunday night to about 5 p.m. Monday afternoon. This could lead to downed trees and outages. Wind gusts on Monday afternoon will be well into the tropical storm force range for all of Georgia and South Carolina. Of particular concern is the duration of the storm surge. Persistent onshore winds will extend the surge component here, with elevated water levels potentially lasting up to 36 hours. Winds over the Keys raged, gusting to at least 94 mph in Key West (before the wind instrument failed) and up to 120 mph in Big Pine Key. Witness video showed the rising storm surge flooding Key West streets. Before its encounter with the Keys, Irma made landfall on the north coast of Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane just after 9 p.m. Friday, with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph. It became that country's first Category 5 hurricane since 1924. Fueled by the extremely warm ocean temperatures, Irma reintensified to the maximum hurricane classification level after weakening slightly on Friday afternoon. As it scraped Cuba's north coast early Saturday, it produced a sustained wind gust of 118 mph, and a gust to 159 mph was reported at Falla, Cuba, in the eyewall of the hurricane. Via NASA On Friday, before making landfall along Cuba's north-central coast, Irma passed north of Haiti and then between Cuba's northeast coast and the Central Bahamas. Thursday evening, the center of the storm passed very close to the Turks and Caicos, producing potentially catastrophic Category 5 winds. The storm surge was of particular concern, as the water had the potential to rise 16 to 20 feet above normally dry land in coastal sections north of the storm center, causing extreme inundation. On Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the hurricane passed directly over Barbuda and St. Martin in the northern Leeward Islands, the strongest hurricane recorded in that region and tied with the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane as the strongest Atlantic storm to strike land. As Barbuda took a direct hit, the weather station there clocked a wind gust to 155 mph before it went offline. The storm also passed directly over Anguilla and St. Martin early Wednesday, causing severe damage. Among the most intense storms on record, it trails only Hurricane Allen in 1980, which had winds of 190 mph. It is tied for second-most intense with Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane. The storm maintained maximum wind speeds of at least 180 mph for 37 hours, longer than any storm on Earth on record, passing Super Typhoon Haiyan, the previous record-holder (24 hours). Late Tuesday, its pressure dropped to 914 millibars (the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm), ranking as the lowest of any storm on record outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the Atlantic basin. It ranks as the seventh-lowest pressure of any U.S. landfalling storm. Capital Weather Gang hurricane expert Brian McNoldy contributed to this report.

However, much of the damage Matthew is expected to inflict on Haiti, in particular, will not be due to the high wind speeds, but rather a staggering amount of rainfall, with forecasts predicting 15 to 25 inches over the next few days.

Hurricane Hazards While hurricanes pose the greatest threat to life and property, tropical storms and depression also can be devastating. The primary hazards from tropical cyclones (which include tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes) are storm surge flooding, inland flooding from heavy rains, destructive winds, tornadoes, and high surf and rip currents. Storm surge is the abnormal rise of water generated by a storm's winds. This hazard is historically the leading cause of hurricane related deaths in the United States. Storm surge and large battering waves can result in large loss of life and cause massive destruction along the coast. Storm surge can travel several miles inland, especially along bays, rivers, and estuaries. Flooding from heavy rains is the second leading cause of fatalities from landfalling tropical cyclones. Widespread torrential rains associated with these storms often cause flooding hundreds of miles inland. This flooding can persist for several days after a storm has dissipated. Winds from a hurricane can destroy buildings and manufactured homes. Signs, roofing material, and other items left outside can become flying missiles during hurricanes. Tornadoes can accompany landfalling tropical cyclones. These tornadoes typically occur in rain bands well away from the center of the storm. Dangerous waves produced by a tropical cyclone's strong winds can pose a significant hazard to coastal residents and mariners. These waves can cause deadly rip currents, significant beach erosion, and damage to structures along the coastline, even when the storm is more than a 1,000 miles offshore. Please Contact Us."},
{"Number":"74","Sentences":"By Brian McNoldy August 25, 2017 Capital Weather Gang's Angela Fritz explains why Harvey will have an effect for days after making landfall on the Texas coast. Ike was a strong Category 2 hurricane at landfall near Galveston. Before Wilma, other recent major hurricane landfalls on the U.S. include Rita (2005), Katrina (2005), Dennis (2005), Jeanne (2004), Ivan (2004), and Charley (2004). The category of a storm is based solely on the maximum wind speed somewhere in the storm. It has nothing to do with the size, the flooding rainfall, the inundating storm surge, the death toll, or the economic toll. Major hurricanes are in a league of their own due to the combination of the all worst of hurricane-related hazards. A tropical cyclone of any intensity, even a depression, can generate tremendous rainfall and cause inland flooding; Irene is a great example of that. Category 1 and 2 hurricanes can create substantial storm surges, as Ike and Sandy illustrated. His website hosted at RSMAS is also quite popular during hurricane season."},

Matthew is expected to become a Category 4 storm again before approaching Florida with winds up to 130 mph, according to an advisory issued at 11 p.m. ET Wednesday by the National Hurricane Center. Nearly 3,500 tourists remain in the Bahamas. Up to 15 inches of rain and up to 15 foot storm surge is expected in the Bahamas from Wednesday through today. ') The storm weakened from a Category 4 hurricane after plowing into Haiti and Cuba, where it left a trail of devastation. By nightfall on Tuesday, the powerful storm was blamed for at 10 deaths in Haiti, which appears to be the hardest-hit country. The U.S. military plans to send nine helicopters and 100 personnel to Haiti today to assist in aid efforts. According to the United Nations, more than 377,000 people were evacuated in Cuba. And in Haiti, at least 350,000 people are in need of immediate assistance following the hurricane's deadly impact. There were reports of a powerful storm surge, violent winds and widespread flooding. Hospitals there are inundated with patients and are running short of necessities, including water. Raging floodwaters severed a key bridge linking the battered southern peninsula with the rest of the impoverished Caribbean nation, raising fears that the worst of the damage has yet to be discovered. ABC News Hurricane Matthew remained an organized and dangerous storm moving through the southern Bahamas this afternoon. Harden said much of the aid will be provided through the Catholic Relief Services and the American Red Cross. The coastal area north of Savannah River in Georgia to Edisto Beach, South Carolina is under a hurricane watch. Destructive winds are expected in the Sunshine State, with major coastal flooding possible from Palm Beach to Fernandina Beach, as well as dangerous surf and rip currents. Some areas could see 10 inches of rain and a 5-foot storm surge. The governors of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina have declared states of emergency, issuing stern warnings for millions of coastal residents to prepare to evacuate as Hurricane Matthew moves northwest at about 10 mph. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said this could be the largest evacuation ever in the Sunshine State. Scott requested that President Barack Obama declare a pre-landfall emergency for the state and to provide government aid in the form of food, water and tarps. Scott also activated 2,500 members of the National Guard and suspended all tolls in the affected areas of the state, including the Florida Turnpike. More than 200,000 Floridians are under mandatory evacuations while another 1.3 million are under voluntary evacuations. School has been canceled today and Friday for close to 2 million Florida school children. Many schools are also closed and people have boarded up their beach-front homes. ABC News The latest track shows Hurricane Matthew nearing Florida's coast as a potential Category 4 hurricane by Friday morning before weakening to a Category 2 while approaching Charleston, South Carolina, on Saturday morning. John Tecklenburg, the mayor or Charleston, South Carolina, pleaded with residents in evacuation zones to leave immediately, saying that those who do not evacuate may not receive assistance. Hurricane Matthew is expected to take aim at Florida's east coast tonight into Friday. The current forecast projects the storm will weaken as it touches the Carolinas on Saturday before heading back out to sea Sunday night.

He had spent years planning for such a storm and, when it hit, he stayed on the air for 23 straight hours, expertly guiding tens of thousands of South Floridians through its wrath from start to finish. His delivery was praised as steady and reassuring. Bryan Norcross Corp.). And it is for this very reason, he stressed, storm preparation is so important. Meanwhile, since 2005, not a single major hurricane, classified Category 3 or higher (on the 1-5 Saffir-Simpson intensity scale), has hit the state. Many Floridians have forgotten what a severe hurricane is like or have never experienced one. Norcross: The coverage that we provided before and during Andrew was only possible because the TV station committed to a program of backing up critical technical systems and producing in-depth specials looking at the hurricane problem. We had been working on our coverage plan for two-and-a-half years, and I had been thinking about it for some years before that. I wish I had pushed for more information from Dade County Emergency Management in the 12 hours before landfall. We had reporters all over town, and the amount of information was at times overwhelming, but, in general, we did not have an overview of how the evacuation was going, the status of the highways, reports from police and hospitals, and other information that would normally come from emergency management. There are other things that I wish had happened differently. Hurricane Andrew, 1992. As an example, nine Category 4-5 hurricanes hit South Florida in a 22-year stretch early in the 20th century. South Florida is not remotely prepared for a Category 3 or higher hurricane. In 2005, Hurricane Wilma was a Category 1 in Miami-Dade County and Category 2 in pockets of Broward and Palm Beach Counties. It ended up being the third most expensive hurricane in the history of hurricanes. The government was barely able to stabilize the situation simply due to the large number of people who were really hurting. From 1926-1969 (44 yrs), 14 Cat. 4-5 hurricanes made U.S. landfall. From 1970-2016 (47 yrs), only 3 Cat. But there are so many more people near the water, in so many more, taller buildings, with so much more wealth that any future hurricane is guaranteed to be much more difficult to manage and recover from than storms of the past. And you could never get anywhere close to 90 percent of the population to fully prepare. There are two kind of worst-case scenarios for Greater Miami-Fort Lauderdale. One is Hurricane Andrew coming ashore 10 to 12 miles farther north so that the destruction corridor includes South Beach, the Port of Miami, the banking district, the Miami International Airport, and the Coral Gables and Doral business districts. Besides the unimaginable destruction and widespread homelessness, it would be dagger to the economic heart of the region. Tourism and business would be incapacitated for an indeterminate length of time. With no jobs and housing, people would have to leave. It is impossible to imagine how the region would resurrect itself and how long it would take. The other worst-case scenario is exactly the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926. In addition, there is a little-mentioned threat from a storm that generates a storm surge in the range of 10 feet along the oceanfront. Tens or hundreds of thousands of people would likely be stranded and immobile in their buildings after the storm. People staying in high-rise buildings would be safe, if they rode out the storm in a lower-level hallway. So people will be stuck in buildings with no power, no water, likely little or no communications, and no way to get out or get people in with supplies and aid for an extended time after the storm. Your book talks a lot about this need to be ready and to plan for the worst-case scenarios. But we are often a society that tends to only respond to immediate threats, not hypotheticals. Their traditional approach has been to provide the raw elements and let communicators aggregate the facts into a message for the public.

Nikki Haley extended the state's mandatory evacuation to Jasper and Colleton counties. Along the coast in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, millions of residents have been urged to head inland as the powerful hurricane makes its approach. The storm is strengthening as it batters the Bahamas and moves toward Florida, the National Hurricane Center says. As of late Thursday morning, the storm is a Category 4 that's expected to near the Florida coast late Thursday and early Friday, the agency forecasts. Hundreds of people died as the storm tore through Haiti, Cuba and the Bahamas, including at least 283 dead in Haiti alone.

Not everyone is retreating from the coast: One resident of Cape Canaveral told the AP he plans to ride out the storm in his RV less than a mile from the shore. Scott exhorted any Floridians thinking similarly to change their minds immediately. Lanes of traffic on Interstate 16, the major east-west corridor leading to Savannah, are being reversed so traffic flows only westward, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Tens of thousands of people on Tybee Island and in low-lying communities had already been ordered to head inland, The Journal-Constitution said. In South Carolina, some 1.1 million people have been urged to leave their homes, The Post and Courier reports. Haley had already taken the unprecedented step of ordering all lanes of Interstate 26 in South Carolina to travel west out of Charleston. The idea for the lane reversal was developed after Hurricane Floyd in 1999, which caused massive congestion as the interstate was packed with fleeing coastal residents. So far, there haven't been reports of excessive congestion in South Carolina. But an altercation between police and a motorist over evacuation routes resulted in the exchange of gunfire late Wednesday, leaving the motorist injured, the AP reports. Floyd, the storm that caused such memorable traffic jams, ultimately veered away from South Carolina and left relatively little damage in the state. Haley told residents that it was still possible that Matthew, too, would shift away, but based on current forecasts, residents should travel at least 100 miles from the coast. On Thursday morning, Haley said some 175,000 South Carolinians had evacuated so far. Governors in all three states have declared a state of emergency in coastal regions. Meanwhile, more than 3,785 flights have been canceled in anticipation of the storm, FlightAware reports. Matthew's arrival near northern Florida and Georgia could pose an unusual threat, Bob Henson writes for Weather Underground. Whether Matthew will actually make landfall is unclear. The AP explains that the eye of the storm doesn't need to cross over land to be dangerous and destructive.

The 16 deadliest storms of the last century Leanna Garfield Sep. 12, 2017, 3:24 PM The devastation from Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, 2005 vs 2015. Now, residents across the Caribbean and Florida are starting to assess the devastation from the storm. One of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded, Irma led to the deaths of at least 41 people. That number is expected to rise. Hurricanes can be so deadly because they often bring uncontrollable winds and flooding. At one point, wind gusts reached 216 mph, fast enough to flip over trains, rip roofs off houses, shatter windows, and suck the ocean away from shorelines. With the invention of the electric telegraph (which made weather forecasting possible), the US National Weather Service started tracking global weather data in the mid-19th century, and established a formal hurricane warning system in 1889. According to the 2017 federal climate change report, t he scale and frequency of extreme weather events has increased over the last four decades. Here's a look at some of the deadliest storms around the world in the past century. Note: The following climate disasters include tropical cyclones, typhoons, and hurricanes, since meteorological classifications differ depending on the location and strength. The death toll counts are also estimations. For many large-scale disasters, it's nearly impossible to know exactly how many remain uncounted or unidentified. There's also still no widespread agreement on how to count victims if storm-related deaths occur months or years after it has passed. AP In 1997, a tropical wave that moved off the African coast into the tropical Atlantic ocean spawned Hurricane Pauline. Between 230 and 500 fatalities were confirmed, making it one of the deadliest Pacific hurricanes to make landfall in Mexico. It made landfall with sustained winds of 115 mph, destroying thousands of homes. Approximately 134 people went missing as well. Wikipedia Commons At the time, the 1990 Andhra Pradesh cyclone was the worst weather disaster to affect Southern India in over a decade. Severe flooding contributed to the deaths of nearly 1,000 people, while some 2.6 million were affected in other ways, including injuries, power outages, lack of access to food or water, or home damage. At its peak, it was a Category 4 storm. The eighth hurricane of the 1976 Pacific hurricane season, Liza brought severe flooding. It killed approximately 1,263 people, and left 20,000 more homeless. It ravaged northern Mexico with wind speeds up to 150 mph. The hurricane dumped heavy rains along its path, which contributed to huge mudslide that claimed approximately 800 victims. Around 1,800 people died in total from the storm. Getty Images One of the costliest weather disasters to happen in the US, Hurricane Katrina devastated areas near the Gulf of Mexico, most notably Haiti and New Orleans, in 2005. A Category 5 storm at its peak, Katrina was responsible for at least 1,833 deaths, the majority caused by wind, storm surge, and the failure of levees. AP Typhoon Haiyan tore across central Philippines, and destroyed more than a million homes in the country's low-lying coastal farming and fishing communities in 2013. The storm killed over 6,000 people. At the time, it was the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean. The storm triggered a giant tidal wave, which wiped out entire villages. Many died from starvation and water-borne diseases in the weeks after the cyclone, if rescue workers did not reach them quickly enough. In Honduras, the slow-moving hurricane dumped up to 4 inches of rain per hour for two days, causing mudslides and mass flooding. Over 11,000 people died from the disaster, and thousands more went missing. One of the strongest cyclones ever recorded in the Northern Indian Ocean, it killed approximately 11,520 people in Pakistan. The cyclone hit a southeast state in the country. Heavy storm surges and winds (up to 155 mph in some areas) contributed to the deaths of at least 14,204 people. AP One of the deadliest tropical cyclones on record, Cyclone Nargis hit India, Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Laos, Yangon, and the Ayeyarwady Region in 2008. Packing winds upward of 120 miles an hour, the storm triggered extreme flooding that contributed to the death of over 138,000 people. Up to 150 mph winds led to a 20-foot surge of floodwater across the region, completely overwhelming some islands. YouTube Typhoon Nina brought severe flooding to the Philippines, causing the Banqiao Dam and a series of smaller nearby dams to collapse in 1975. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that 229,000 people died in the disaster. It reached its peak with winds of 115 mph. Between 300,000 and 500,000 people, including approximately 100,000 fishermen, died in the aftermath of the cyclone. Most deaths were attributed to a large storm surge that overwhelmed the islands and tidal flats, wiped out villages, and destroyed crops near the Bay of Bengal. All rights reserved.

A hurricane warning is also in effect for Sint Maarten or St. Martin and St. Barthelemy, also known as St. Barts. Travel to and from St. Martin has been temporarily halted until the storm subsides. Interior Minister Ronald Plasterk said Saturday that Jose is forecast to track northwest of St. Martin and will likely dump a lot of rain on buildings, many of which had roofs torn off by Irma. Rutte issued a warning to looters that the troops and police will clamp down hard to end the lawlessness. Many of those already impacted by Irma fled the islands on ferries and fishing boats as Jose drew near. Despite the cleanup efforts underway in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, residents and officials are concerned that Jose could draw the recovery period out even further.

Early Thursday, Matthew was centered about 255 miles southeast of West Palm Beach, Florida, moving northwest at 12 mph. Along the East Coast, people boarded up beach homes, some schools closed and residents began clearing out. The storm was forecast to scrape much of the Florida coast and any slight deviation could mean landfall or it heading farther out to sea.

Hundreds of thousands of Americans headed for higher ground Wednesday as Hurricane Matthew barreled toward the Florida and South Carolina coasts and the death toll from the monster storm climbed to at least 25. Evacuations were underway in Florida and South Carolina after Matthew, which hammered Haiti and strafed Cuba, began battering the Bahamas. NBC News meteorologist Sherri Pugh said the latest data from the National Hurricane Center indicated that Matthew could shift to a dangerous path immediately along the coast of Florida near Melbourne and Daytona Beach on Friday, resulting in landfall and hurricane conditions for millions along the coast. Thursday morning: Some strengthening, with the worst conditions occurring in Nassau. Thursday afternoon and evening: Matthew will be over the northern Bahamas, with some rain reaching southern Florida. Friday morning: Highest impacts near Melbourne, Fla., with hurricane conditions and possible landfall. Friday afternoon and evening: Central coastal Florida experiencing hurricane conditions through the day. Saturday morning: Depending on the position, coastal South Carolina (around Charleston) or Savannah, Ga., could have strong wind and rain. Saturday afternoon and evening: Matthew could be moving eastward, with Myrtle Beach, S.C., feeling lesser impacts. On Florida's east coast, mandatory evacuations were underway from the barrier islands in Brevard County, and many coastal residents in Duval, Volusia and Flagler counties were already starting to head inland. Drivers won't be charged tolls on major roadways leading out of the region, including all of the Florida Turnpike, officials said.

Hurricane season doesn't hit its peak until September 10 and normally, the average date of the fourth hurricane in a year is September 21.

CSU most recently predicted 16 named storms, eight hurricanes, and said three of those would be major. Irma is making a long journey across the Atlantic that will test prediction science, according to Ventrice. A number of models have Irma headed a bit further north than the Gulf, either pointed towards the East Coast or potentially turning away. While conditions have been particularly favorable to hurricane formation recently, Ventrice said that wouldn't necessarily remain the case throughout the season. The Weather Channel predicts a dip in activity right around the theoretical peak, sometime after Irma. By that point in time, Ventrice said he expected the conditions causing storms to form off the coast of Africa could come to an end, but we could see an uptick in storms forming in the Caribbean. The climatological peak doesn't mean it'll always be the strongest time of year for storms just because it's the annual average, he said. Another measure that meteorologists use to track the force of storms we've experienced so far is accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), which takes into account the number of storms we've seen, how powerful they've been, and how long they lasted, according to Klotzbach. Since that measure usually jumps significantly after this point, Klotzbach said it's an indication of more storms ahead. All rights reserved.

{"Number":"102","Sentences":"Hurricane Jose was 840 miles east of Florida early Wednesday, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, making it a Category 1 storm. The storm is expected to remain at hurricane intensity in the Western Atlantic, and it could strengthen as it takes an odd, looping path that may bring it near the Bahamas and the United States this weekend. However, most computer models indicate Jose will stay out to sea and complete a tight enough loop to avoid moving onshore. Jose's impact is sure to be felt along the Southeast coast, bringing rough seas. Such a path is concerning in the wake of Hurricane Irma, which has altered the beach landscape and made it more vulnerable to coastal erosion and flooding. Jose's twisting path The track for Hurricane Jose is a strange one. In a pocket of weak steering winds in the open Atlantic, Jose is expected to make a clockwise loop. It will initially move farther away from the United States before coming closer to the Bahamas and East Coast. Click here to track the storm A westward motion is the result of a ridge of high pressure to the north and then east of the storm. The strength and location of this ridge will determine how far Jose moves westward before eventually turning north and then east again. Two of the most robust computer models meteorologists use to determine the odds of landfall -- GFS, the American forecast model, and the ECMWF, the European one -- keep Jose over the ocean. But models can have trouble forecasting unusual tracks such as Jose's expected path. There is generally not a dominant weather feature that is steering the storm, so model forecasts can vary widely between each other and from run to run. The center's official forecast finds Jose just over 400 miles from Jacksonville, Florida on Sunday morning. Still, the cone of uncertainty comes uncomfortably close, within 200 miles of Florida and 50 miles from the Bahamas. The storm may bring a high risk of rip currents, too. Jose already has threatened other hurricane-weary countries. As a much stronger Category 4 storm, the hurricane passed only 85 miles from the island nation of Antigua and Barbuda last weekend. Tropical storm-force winds from Jose spread over the islands on Saturday. Only three days earlier, Antigua and Barbuda had been devastated by a peak-strength Category 5 Irma, packing 185-mph winds. Hurricane season still ongoing Before this hurricane season, the United States had gone a record 12 years without a major hurricane landfall. But with Harvey and Irma, it has now experienced two Category 4 landfalls in 16 days. There have already been six named hurricanes this season: Franklin, Gert, Harvey, Irma, Jose and Katia. If history is a guide, more will be on the way. The full hurricane season lasts until November 30, although the peak season generally stretches from about mid-August to mid-October. But hurricanes into November and even December are not unheard of. Last year, Hurricane Otto formed on November 20 and made landfall in Nicaragua as a Category 2 storm.

{"Number":"115","Sentences":"Whether the Category 5 hurricane makes a close pass or a direct hit is uncertain, but one thing is clear: Coastal residents need to make preparations now for a storm that is sure to leave a mark. Two big factors will govern the ultimate path Irma takes. This system, around which winds flow clockwise, acts as a guardrail to Irma, shunting it farther south and west like a pinball, and preventing it from heading out to sea. The stronger the ridge, the greater the probability that its westward movement will continue. We are in the home stretch. Frustrating for FLA yet this is just how the slowing & turning cyclones go. No easy early answer of precision. This is a zone of low pressure spinning away over the southern Tennessee Valley within a dip in the jet stream, that spins counterclockwise. This will eventually capture Irma into its overall circulation, but the strength and forward speed of that feature will determine Irma's propensity to move inland. Based on how these two important weather features evolve and interact with Irma, four scenarios seem plausible, the first three of which seem about equally likely: Scenario 1: An extremely close shave, but no Florida landfall (possible) GFS model simulation showing Irma just off the east coast of Florida at 8 a.m. Sunday. Since Wednesday morning, a number of model simulations have forecast Hurricane Irma making a right turn before Florida and riding northward, tracking just offshore of the Sunshine State. In this scenario, Miami would be spared the dangerous right-hand side of the storm. Hurricanes are most dangerous to the right of their center, since their rotating winds couple with the storm's forward motion, making the gusts inside that much stronger. This would occur in the Saturday-Sunday time frame. The Florida Keys would see less in the way of impacts, contrary to the dire circumstances portrayed by a consensus of model depictions on Tuesday. However, a storm surge or rise in water above normally dry land of 4 to 8 feet would still be likely along the immediate shores of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, thanks to northerly winds stemming from the storm's counterclockwise circulation. Think of a hurricane like a spinning top; because the top rotates so quickly, it may jog left or right a little bit as it treks along while rotating furiously. Irma is the same way. This would buffet seaside communities with rain and wind, but it would be akin to a strong tropical storm or low-end hurricane, and keep the bulk of any major concerns offshore. There's yet another ingredient complicating this forecast: the presence of Hurricane Jose east of the Leeward Islands. Potential interaction with the newly-formed hurricane, in an elegant dance known as the Fujiwhara Effect, could affect Irma's path. This occurs when hurricanes in proximity orbit one another about a common center, but it depends on how close of an approach Jose makes. Right now, it's looking like the two won't begin to orbit one another until Sunday or Monday, but that could help slow down Irma's motion. If that were to occur, it could be more easily snagged by the wave of low pressure over Southeast, slingshotted northward. This would put the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina in extreme jeopardy. Clearly, there are a lot of moving parts that could alter this first scenario. In this scenario, the system may make landfall in southern Florida as a major hurricane of at least Category 4 strength. No words. A catastrophic storm surge would sweep ashore, while devastating inland flooding would result from excessive rainfall. Scenario 3: Riding up the spine of Florida; landfall closer to the Keys (possible) European model simulation showing Irma on the southern tip of Florida at 8 a.m. Some models are hinting that Irma may wait longer to turn north, which would spell big problems for the southern peninsula, the Keys, and areas south of Okeechobee. In this scenario, Irma would move ashore somewhere between the Keys and Miami. All of Florida would see wind and rain, but the heaviest would be relegated to areas south of Route 75, including the Everglades, Homestead and Key Biscayne. The worst conditions would sweep ashore to the right side of the eye, exposing the Miami metro area to extreme hurricane-force winds, a surge of at least several feet, and torrential downpours. Locations left of the center on Florida's west coast would experience Irma's weaker side but would still be exposed to strong tropical storm or weak hurricane conditions. The most destructive winds and devastating storm surge would occur in southwest Florida, assuming that's where the center first comes ashore. It's not out of the question models could shift west in this direction. The bottom line It will be at least another one or two days before we are fully able to iron out the details of the forecast over Florida, and longer for the Carolinas and the U.S. southeastern coast. Errors in the track forecast are as wide as the Florida peninsula at this juncture. Interests in any of the potentially affected areas should keep an eye to the latest forecasts and prepare, as Irma is a force to be reckoned with."},

Michael Joseph, president of the Red Cross in Antigua and Barbuda, described Barbuda as though it were a tropical ghost town of broken buildings and fallen trees. Though badly damaged, the restaurant was planning to open Friday and serve limited lunch and dinner items. The people here are good and friendly. The U.S. military has dispatched six warships, plus helicopters, cargo planes, National Guard troops and thousands of pounds of supplies to help hurricane victims throughout the Caribbean. On Saturday, three Navy vessels were positioned off the Virgin Islands, with troops going ashore in battered St. Thomas to conduct medical evacuations, search-and-rescue missions and to help clear debris. The other three ships, inbound from Norfolk, were delayed. Jose had forced them to adjust course while in transit, the Pentagon said. The military will provide generators, fuel and gas, water-purification systems and tools to clear roads choked with storm debris, according to the U.S. Northern Command. The Army Corps of Engineers sent teams to U.S. territories to help restore electricity, and National Guard personnel were activated to help with evacuations and search-and-rescue efforts. They want to get off the island. They need supplies. The French government deployed 455 police, military and other personnel on Friday, with double that number expected by Saturday. Saturday. The presence was partly to restore public order and combat a wave of looting. Using Guadeloupe as a base, French officials were dispatching military helicopters and civilian aircraft with food, water and medical supplies. Yet Jose could quickly jeopardize those relief efforts, authorities warned. The U.S. military on Saturday said five C-130 transport planes were evacuating Americans trapped on St. Martin, but that Jose would slow the effort. Nearly 900 people had been flown to Puerto Rico between Friday and Saturday afternoon, with flights expected to resume Sunday, according to the Pentagon. With no power or running water, they were desperate for information about whether assistance was on the way. The couple had been heading back to Florida after celebrating their 20th wedding anniversary on the nearby island of Saba. Once Irma cleared St. Martin, they used their intermittent cell service to text relatives back in the United States for help in figuring out how to get home. But with the airport seriously damaged, there was no way out. Communications were mostly down and many roads were blocked with vehicles, telephone poles, metal roof material and other debris. He described a sense of frustration about the response by the British government. Rogers said residents were most concerned about whether Hurricane Jose would cause further damage. Irma, meanwhile, continued to push west, making landfall in Cuba around 11 p.m. Eastern Friday and gaining strength on its march toward the Bahamas and, eventually, Florida. The Cuban government moved hundreds of thousands of people away from cities and towns along the coast in preparation for Irma, including some 36,000 tourists from hotels and beach resorts that are likely to be pounded. State media showed images Friday of soldiers and Cuban civil defense brigades moving residents into shelters. Children and elderly residents could be seen in them, eating sandwiches and snacks in the near-darkness. And as the rains diminished over vulnerable Haiti, residents and aid organizations began to assess the damage.

Texans want Trump to help build 'hurricane wall' The 2017 hurricane season officially began June 1 and ends November 30. Though NOAA's outlook still calls for 5 to 9 hurricanes, the latest update increases the number of likely major hurricanes by one, to 5. Read More Hurricane Franklin, located in the southern Gulf of Mexico's Bay of Campeche, is the season's first hurricane and will move into Mexico early on Thursday. Click here to track Franklin NOAA's upgraded outlook agrees with last week's update from Colorado State University. CSU predicts 16 named storms -- including the five that have already occurred -- with eight becoming hurricanes and three reaching major hurricane status (winds above 111 mph). Tropical Storm Arlene formed briefly in April in the north-central Atlantic. An extremely rare occurrence, Arlene was just the second named storm on record for the month of April. Since then the season has remained above average with respect to the number of storms, with six named storms by August 6. On average, the sixth named storm does not occur for another month, around September 8. Even though the calendar says we are over one-third of the way through the hurricane season, we are just getting into its busiest part. As if on cue, the tropical Atlantic has been heating up this week, with Franklin churning in the southern Gulf of Mexico and another area of potential development farther out in the ocean. Franklin has already prompted hurricane warnings for parts of Mexico's east coast as the system will move into the Mexican state of Veracruz late Wednesday into early Thursday. Several hundred miles to the east, a disorganized cluster of storms bears watching as it moves towards near the Lesser Antilles. It is still too early to say for sure if the system, which would be named Gert if it develops, would curve back out to sea before reaching the US coast. One of its effects is increased wind shear across the tropical Atlantic, which creates hostile conditions for tropical storm development. Amazingly, the US has not experienced landfall of a major hurricane -- a Category 3 or higher, with sustained winds of 111 mpg and higher -- since Hurricane Wilma in 2005. That streak nearly ended last year with Hurricane Matthew. After several quieter seasons, 2016 was above normal, as expected, with 15 named storms, seven hurricanes and four major hurricanes. Hurricane Matthew had the greatest impact, with its center passing just offshore of eastern Florida and Georgia as a major hurricane before making landfall in South Carolina as a Category 1 storm and bringing historic flooding to North Carolina.

{"Number":"122","Sentences":"Retropolis As Hurricane Harvey slams Texas, a look at the most devastating storms in U.S. history By Petula Dvorak , Columnist August 26, 2017 A hurricane in 1900 devastated Galveston, Tex., and killed at least 6,000 people. Fake news. The story was buried on Page 3 of the Daily News that morning, Sept. 8. People paid dearly for ignoring the scientists. Despite wind and rain that morning, folks went about their business. But by late afternoon, the houses along the beaches began crashing down. The bridges to the mainland collapsed. People trying to flee the winds were killed by hurtling bricks and lumber; some were decapitated by pieces of roof slate knifing through the air. Between 6,000 and 8,000 were killed. The morning of Sept. 9, after a night of winds thought to have reached 120 miles per hour, Galveston was mountains of debris and bodies. The Great Hurricane of 1900 in Galveston remains the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history. Now another monster storm, Hurricane Harvey, is slamming Texas. It roared ashore in Corpus Christi at 10 p.m. Central time Friday with 130 mph winds and as much as 40 inches of rain. It was unclear how many people heeded the warnings before the storm hit. More than 6,000 people were killed and 10,000 left homeless from the Great Storm, which remains the worst natural disaster in U.S. history. AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Among the costliest hurricanes in the United States hit Miami in 1926. It ravaged a coast that had just undergone an explosive building boom. Little remained after the storm. The National Weather Service in Washington issued a warning on Sept. 14, as the storm hit the Bahamas. When it reached Miami four days later, it first hit as an intense storm but not a devastating one. But it had a second act. Forecasters seeing reports and tracking patterns issued a dire warning at 11 p.m. on Sept. 18, after most folks went to sleep. The storm killed 372 people and left at least 43,000 homeless. That storm remains among the most intense to ever hit the United States. It killed a little more than 400 people. An evacuation train getting them to the mainland was completely blown off its track during the storm. No one was killed when that happened, but many of the 259 veterans who died in the storm were those left behind when the evacuation efforts failed. Hurricane Hazel slams Morehead City, N.C., on Oct. 15, 1954. The homes above faced the mile-wide Bogue Sound, which was protected by an outer bank strand better known as Atlantic Beach. Dozens of trees on the U.S. Capitol grounds fell as Hazel clocked nearly 100 mph winds in Washington and Virginia. The storm swept on to Canada, where Toronto was hit on Oct. 15, leaving 81 people dead and nearly 4,000 homeless. By 1969, satellite technology was a powerful tool in reading and predicting weather. But that did little to help the Mississippi Gulf Coast when Hurricane Camille did not take an expected turn to the east. Biloxi radio stations broadcast frantic evacuation warnings as the water rose over bridges after the sudden change of course. About 250 people died in that hurricane. That was largely thanks to an intense evacuation and preparation effort. There were 142 shelters opened, and more than 1.2 million people heeded the warnings and fled. The storm helped meteorologists make big leaps in predicting weather patterns, and it helped expose shoddy construction practices across Florida. And then, of course, there was Hurricane Katrina, the 2005 storm that devastated New Orleans. People wade through floodwaters in front of the Superdome in New Orleans on Aug. 30, 2005 after Hurricane Katrina. The storm killed 1,245 people in New Orleans and several hundred more in Mississippi. More than a million people fled Louisina, Texas and the Gulf Coast following hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Though many returned to their homes or moved elsewhere, at least 100,000 of them stayed in Houston, changing the character of that city. Read more Retropolis: An asteroid was streaking toward Earth.

As of 2 a.m. ET, Matthew was heading northwest and maintained the earlier speed at 10 mph with top sustained winds of 115 mph, having weakend slightly since daytime. Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said Wednesday there is a 25 percent chance of the county getting hurricane force winds, but no evacuations were planned at the moment. A tropical storm warning was in effect for the Florida Keys from Seven Mile Bridge eastward. At least 25 deaths had been blamed on the powerful storm during its weeklong march across the Caribbean, 19 of them in Haiti. The mayor of Petit Goave, a coastal community west of the capital Port-au-Prince, told NBC News 14 people had died there, and the country's Civil Agency has confirmed five people dead with another missing. Two days after the hurricane rampaged across Haiti's remote southwestern peninsula with roaring winds and flooding rains, local authorities and international aid workers still lack a clear picture of the storm's destruction. Dramatic Images From Hurricane Matthew AP But the weather began calming Wednesday and a way was found around a key bridge that was washed away, allowing convoys and helicopters to start ventruing to marooned corners to assess the damage and determine how to help thousands of people who lost homes, livestock and crops.

UpdatedDeath Toll Rises as Haiti Digs Out From Hurricane Matthew Still, Mourad Wahba, the U.N. secretary-general's deputy special representative for Haiti, called the hurricane the biggest humanitarian crisis in Haiti since the devastating earthquake of 2010. Additionally, four people were killed because of the storm in the Dominican Republic and one each in Colombia and the Carribbean (where a boulder fell on a 16-year-old boy in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines). Tropical storm conditions began spreading over the southeastern Bahamas early Thursday, and Bahamas Prime Minister Perry Christie voiced concern about the potential impact on the sprawling archipelago off Florida's east coast. Hurricane Matthew Smashes Haiti Footage of the gale-force winds in Les Cayes, Haiti. There was growing concern on the U.S. East Coast, where nearly two million people were told to evacuate given the threat of Matthew's storm surge up the length of the Bahamas. People raced to supermarkets, gas stations and hardware stores, buying up groceries, water, plywood, tarps, batteries and propane. Gov. Scott urged coastal residents to prepare for the possibility of a direct hit and line up three days' worth of food, water and medicine. The White House said relief supplies were being moved to emergency staging areas in the Southeast. The slow-moving storm was expected to drench the coast from the Florida Keys through central Florida, bring storm surge up to 5 feet deep along the Atlantic coast and possibly spawn tornadoes. Even if Matthew doesn't come ashore, its tropical storm-force winds could reach the state. Mandatory evacuations were already underway in Brevard County, and voluntary evacuations have been activated in St. Lucie County, but Gov. Scott urged other coastal residents potentially in harm's way not to wait to be told to leave. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley ordered residents in Charleston and Beaufort counties to leave on Wednesday ahead of the hurricane. She said evacuations in Georgetown and Horry counties will come on Thursday. Several cruise ships were rerouted from their scheduled trips to the Caribbeans and Bahamas to Key West, about 40 miles south of the portion of Florida currently not under a tropical storm warning. VideoHurricane Matthew Quiets Campaign Ahead of Debate Matthew was at one point a Category 5 storm, making it the most powerful hurricane in the region in nearly a decade. It blew ashore around dawn Tuesday in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and a place where many people live in shacks of wood or concrete blocks. In Haiti, where international aid efforts were stymied Tuesday because of the lack of access to the hardest-hit areas, many residents of flooded areas seen by Associated Press reporters were wading through shin-high waters. Muddy rivers and tributaries continued to rise as water flowed down hillsides and mountains, making more flash floods and mudslides possible even as Matthew tracked away from the country. NOAA Crew Flies Into Eye of Hurricane Matthew A flight crew from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) flew into the eye of Hurricane Matthew on Oct. 6.

{"Number":"128","Sentences":"For nearly two days, monstrous Hurricane Irma has sustained Category 5 winds of at least 180 miles per hour while ripping through the northern Lesser Antilles and Virgin Islands. The storm, tied for the second-strongest ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, is headed for the southeastern Bahamas and, by the weekend and early next week, Florida and the Southeast United States. It added hurricanes watches would be issued for parts of the Florida Keys and Florida Peninsula late Thursday morning. Preparations should be rushed to completion along and near its projected path, including over South Florida. At 5 a.m. Its peak winds were estimated at 180 miles per hour, a slight decrease in strength from Wednesday. The storm's heavier rain bands which had been lashing Puerto Rico into Wednesday evening had retreated to the northwest and just scattered showers lingered Thursday morning. In a bit of fortunate news, the storm's eyewall, the region with the most destructive winds, had passed to its north. With the storm heading west-northwest, hurricane warnings were in effect for the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos, Haiti and the Bahamas. A hurricane watch covered Cuba. It will produce the full gamut of hurricane hazards across the Bahamas and potentially South Florida, including a devastating storm surge, destructive winds and dangerous flash flooding. Meanwhile, two new hurricanes formed late Wednesday afternoon in the Atlantic basin: Jose in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and Katia in the southwest Gulf of Mexico (see more information down below). But enough uncertainty in the track exists that all of Florida should be on the highest alert and preparing for this hurricane. Some of the computer simulations on Wednesday tracked the storm center very near Southeast Florida Sunday morning, which would present a very dangerous situation for the Miami to Fort Lauderdale area. However, shifts in the storm track are likely. Model simulations of the center of Irma at 2 p.m. Sunday. Tropical-storm-force winds are likely to arrive in Florida on Saturday, with the worst storm conditions occurring Sunday. The most extreme conditions are likely to occur near the storm center, but it is impossible this far out to pinpoint exactly where that will track. And serious storm effects will expand well outside the center. The entire Florida peninsula is only about 100 miles wide, small compared to the size of the storm. Tropical-storm-force winds presently extend outward up to 185 miles from the storm center and hurricane-force winds extend 50 miles away. Saffir-Simpson category rating of a hurricane only refers to peak winds in eyewall. Remember, the category rating only refers to the peak winds in the eyewall, not the size of the storm, the rainfall and the storm surge. The rainfall forecast for the coming week shows a heavy swath over the Florida peninsula, and then spreading northward into the Carolinas as Irma likely tracks over those areas early next week. A flash flooding warning was also issued. The Hurricane Center provides this description of the potential damage inflicted by Category 5 winds: A high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months. As the storm passes just north of the Dominican Republic and Haiti on Thursday, hurricane-force winds and torrential rains are possible. Later on Thursday, the storm will near the Turks and Caicos and southeastern Bahamas, where it could push ashore a devastating storm surge of 15 to 20 feet above normally dry land. Irma's path through the Northern Lesser Antilles Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the hurricane passed directly over Barbuda and Saint Martin in the northern Leeward Islands, the strongest hurricane ever recorded in that region and tied with the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane as the strongest Atlantic storm to strike land. As Barbuda took a direct hit, the weather station there clocked a wind gust to 155 mph before it went offline. The storm surge on the island, or the rise in water above normally dry land, reached at least 8 feet. Widespread destruction was reported on the island. The storm also passed directly over Anguilla and St. Martin early Wednesday, causing severe damage. Among the most intense storms on record, it only trails Hurricane Allen in 1980, which had winds of 190 mph. It is tied for second most intense with Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane. The storm has maintained maximum wind speeds of at least 185 mph longer than any other storm on Earth in recorded history. Late Tuesday night, its pressure dropped to 914 millibars (the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm), ranking as the lowest of any storm on record outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the Atlantic basin. The storm has generated the most Accumulated Cyclone Energy, a measure of both a storm's duration and intensity, of any hurricane on record. Without a doubt, the World Meteorological Organization will retire the names Harvey and Irma after this season. Two Category 4 hurricanes hit in Texas and Louisiana six weeks apart that year. Credit to tropical weather expert and occasional Capital Weather Gang contributor Phil Klotzbach for some of the statistics in this section. Hurricanes Jose and Katia While Irma is grabbing all of the attention, two other hurricanes are spinning in the Atlantic basin: Tropical Storm Jose was upgraded to a hurricane late Wednesday afternoon. Positioned far out in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the storm was rapidly gaining strength and was forecast to become a major Category 3 storm by Friday. The current track forecast keeps it mostly away from land areas over the next couple of days but brings it close to the same islands in the northeastern Lesser Antilles slammed by Irma this weekend and forecasters will be watching it closely. Tropical Storm Katia, which formed early Wednesday in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, intensified quickly into a hurricane late Wednesday afternoon. It could intensify into a Category 2 hurricane before making landfall in the Mexico state of Veracruz Friday into Saturday, where a hurricane warning is in effect. And now we also have Jose and Katia adding to the tally. He earned a master's degree in atmospheric science and spent 10 years as a climate change science analyst for the U.S. government. He holds the Digital Seal of Approval from the National Weather Association. His website hosted at RSMAS is also quite popular during hurricane season."},

Earlier, hurricane warnings were in effect for St. Martin and St. Barthelemy. Both of those islands were already devastated by Hurricane Irma, which first made landfall early Wednesday. Those warning have been canceled. Luckily, the storm seems to be veering north, so its center will likely miss the islands of Barbuda and Anguilla, which are both still reeling from destruction caused by Irma. National Hurricane Center Although forecasters are watching Jose, Irma remains the most pressing concern, since the Category 4 storm has started to hit Florida. Many parts of Florida, including the Keys and parts of the Miami area, have been been evacuated. Meanwhile, the US is still recovering from the devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall on August 25 and severely flooded parts of Texas and Louisiana. The storm dumped as much as 51.88 inches of rain in some spots and caused at least 60 deaths. The peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is around September 10, so it's not uncommon for storms to form during this time of year. However, 2017 has been an unusually active year for hurricanes.

{"Number":"138","Sentences":"Capital Weather Gang Enormous Hurricane Irma stays on perilous path toward South Florida, now under warning By Jason Samenow , Weather editor Brian McNoldy September 8, 2017 (This story, first posted Thursday, will be updated through Friday morning. It was last updated to reflect the 8 a.m. Hurricane Irma, the massive, record-setting hurricane, continues on a collision course with South Florida where severe, if not catastrophic, damage is becoming inevitable. By early next week, Georgia and the Carolinas could also be in the storm's crosshairs. The storm is comparable in strength to Hurricane Andrew, which decimated parts of South Florida in 1992, but much larger in size. Thursday night, as the storm charged ever closer to the U.S. mainland, the National Hurricane Center issued hurricane warnings for the Florida peninsula from Jupiter Inlet southward and around the peninsula to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys. Hurricane and storm surge watches extended north of the warning area on Florida's east and west coast up to Sebastian Inlet and Anna Maria Island. Closer to the storm's immediate location, hurricane warnings remained in effect for the Bahamas, and northern Cuba. Irma was forecast to pass between the Central Bahamas and north coast of Cuba Friday, according to the Hurricane Center. Packing peak winds of 150 mph, Irma was an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm Friday morning. It is possible the storm could regain Category 5 intensity if it remains clear of large land masses, which would disrupt the storm. There is a scenario in which the center could scrape Cuba's north coast, which would weaken it. However, Irma is still to pass over some of the warmest water in the world (nearly 90 degrees), which could allow for restrengthening. It urged residents of Florida to rush preparations to completion. On Saturday, Jose could hit some of the same small islands in the northern Lesser Antilles decimated by Irma, including Antigua and Barbuda. Caption Irma is wielding the most powerful winds ever recorded for a storm in the Atlantic Ocean. Thais Llorca Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Potential effects on Florida and the Southeast U.S. In South Florida, this storm is being taken as deadly serious. Coastal areas are being evacuated, shelters are being established, and food and gas supplies have dwindled. Although there is uncertainty in the track and the exact path of the violent eye wall, where winds are the strongest, it will be difficult for the state to avoid a disaster: It's just a matter of how severe. Then, the all-important northward turn is still expected to take place early Sunday, when the storm would make landfall and unleash its worst effects. Exactly where the north turn occurs is the critical question for Florida. As of Friday morning, the most likely scenario based on computer-model guidance was that the storm will track between right up the spine of Florida to near its East Coast. Group of simulations from American (blue) and European (red) computer models from Thursday night. Each color strand represents a different model simulation with slight tweaks to initial conditions. Note that the strands are clustered together where the forecast track is most confident but they diverge where the course of the storm is less certain. The difference between a track just off the east coast and just off the west coast is only 150 miles, and the average error in hurricane forecasts this far in advance is nearly that big. It is still not out of the question that Irma could track north up the west coast of the Florida peninsula. If it runs up the spine of the peninsula, the storm will be quicker to decay but hurricane-force winds would reach both coasts. If it buzz-saws up the west coast, then Key West, Naples, Fort Myers, Tampa and Tallahassee would face severe effects. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles downed. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months. Note that such extreme winds are typically confined to the eye wall, which is only about 10 to 15 miles wide. That is why the exact track is important in terms of where the most severe wind damage concentrates. Forecast position of Hurricane Irma at 8 a.m. Sunday. Irrespective of exactly where Irma tracks, it appears inevitable that many coastal population centers in Florida will experience a devastating storm surge of 5 to 10 feet above normally dry land, inundating roads, homes and businesses. The biggest storm surge will occur immediately north of the storm center. Over the Florida peninsula, 8 to 20 inches of rain is forecast, with the heaviest amounts most likely in the southeast. Beyond Florida, there is a risk for destructive winds and a serious storm surge up to Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, but the details greatly depend on the track over Florida. The worst case for these states would be if Irma narrowly misses the east coast of Florida, stays over warm water and then hits them while maintaining its strength. A potential landfall along the Southeast coast would be Monday. However, a number of models early Friday suggested the storm would pass over Florida's spine and into interior Georgia, such that there would be no second landfall from Irma along the Southeast coast. Rainfall forecast from Irma. As the storm tracks up the Southeast coast and then inland, heavy rain will expand over a large area, along with the potential for flash flooding, although it's too soon to pinpoint what areas will receive the most rain. Effects on the Turks and Caicos and Bahamas Thursday evening, the center of the storm passed very close to the Turks and Caicos, producing potentially catastrophic Category 5 winds and 8 to 12 inches (locally up to 20 inches) of rain. The storm surge was of particular concern, as the water had the potential to rise 16 to 20 feet above normally dry land in coastal sections north of the storm center, causing extreme inundation. The Hurricane Center noted that the southern Bahamas and northern Cuba could receive 10 to 15 inches of rain with isolated 20-inch totals. Irma's path so far Through early Thursday, the storm had battered islands from Puerto Rico to the northern Lesser Antilles. Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, the hurricane passed directly over Barbuda and St. Martin in the northern Leeward Islands, the strongest hurricane ever recorded in that region and tied with the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane as the strongest Atlantic storm to strike land. As Barbuda took a direct hit, the weather station there clocked a wind gust to 155 mph before it went offline. The storm also passed directly over Anguilla and St. Martin early Wednesday, causing severe damage. Among the most intense storms on record, it trails only Hurricane Allen in 1980, which had winds of 190 mph. It is tied for second-most intense with Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane. The storm maintained maximum wind speeds of at least 180 mph for 37 hours, longer than storm on Earth on record, passing Super Typhoon Haiyan, the previous recordholder (24 hours). Late Tuesday, its pressure dropped to 914 millibars (the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm), ranking as the lowest of any storm on record outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the Atlantic basin.

Hurricane season update We are nearing the halfway point of the hurricane season in terms of overall activity, and this season has ranked almost double what's normal (183 percent of average). This is largely due to the massive contribution from Irma, but also from Harvey as well as recent additions Jose and Katia.

It blew ashore around dawn in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and a place where many people live in shacks of wood or concrete blocks. Surging waters ripped away a bridge in the flooded town of Petit Goave, preventing any road travel to the hard-hit southwest. Local radio reported shoulder-high water in parts of the southern city of Les Cayes. Matthew swept away parts of Les Cayes, and resident George Elie told CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann it was devastating. Everything is gone. Milriste Nelson, a 65-year-old farmer in the town of Leogane, said neighbors fled when the wind tore away the corrugated metal roof on their home. His own small yard was strewn with the fruit he depends on for his livelihood. Haitian authorities had tried to evacuate people from the most vulnerable areas ahead of the storm, but many were reluctant to leave their homes. Some sought shelter only after the worst was already upon them. Rainfall totals were predicted to reach 15 to 25 inches in Haiti, with up to 40 inches in isolated places. All Rights Reserved.

{"Number":"143","Sentences":"Experts say U.S. satellite data simply cannot do the job. Its members trace the origin of hurricane hunting to a 1943 barroom dare by two then-Army Air Corps pilots to fly through a hurricane off Texas. Today, the missions are carried out largely by Air Force reservists who, after a few days or weeks of chasing storms, return to their jobs in the civilian world. Hitterman, 49, flies for Delta Airlines most of the time and, as a hobby, races motorcycles. She normally lives in Minnesota. The way Mitchell sees it, the more accurate her data is, the more accurate the forecasts can be that tell U.S. citizens whether to evacuate their homes as Irma or other storms advance. Millions of Florida residents have been ordered to evacuate. The last time was in 1974. But they are not without risk. Some six hurricane or typhoon hunting aircraft have been lost in total, costing 53 lives, according to the Weather Underground website. The pilot lost control of the aircraft, one of the engines caught on fire, and the aircraft descended rapidly, all because satellite data had given his crew the sense they were flying into a Category 3 storm. It turned out to be a Category 5. They were flying much too low for a storm that potent. On the mission into Irma, jolts of turbulence also shook the equipment in the cabin as it neared the eye of the hurricane. Emergency parachutes swayed. It was safe enough to take off seat belts. The flying was smooth. Inside the eye, the sky opened up. DRONES AND SONDES Masters says someday drones might be able to do the risky job now done by experienced air crews. But, from the cockpit of this Hurricane Hunter flight, that possibility still seems distant. Some of that equipment is operated manually. So, Moore took out a screwdriver and literally started fixing them on the fly, one by one. That is something a drone would not be able to do. Hitterman said he also could see a future where pilotless planes fly into hurricanes to get the data Americans need. Please read our Commenting Policy first.

The last hurricane to make landfall in November was Otto last year. Warmer water could be a key ingredient for a hurricane, but in these case, the water may have warmed regardless of climate change, he said. The most direct ways climate change influences hurricane landfalls can come in the form of increased storm surge as a result of sea level rise. So far this year, there have been five tropical storms and six hurricanes, including Irma, Jose and Katia. 2 more hurricanes form as Jose and Katia intensify.

It also sucked away ocean water from the shoreline at some beaches in the Bahamas. Over the weekend, several Twitter users posted videos and photos of what was left after the water seemingly disappeared during Hurricane Irma. Conch shells sat on damp, rocky sand and docks stood with no water beneath them. The eerie phenomenon came as a result of the powerful hurricane. The center of the storm has low pressure that draws water upward, according to the Washington Post. Wayne Neely, a forecaster with the Bahamas Department of Meteorology, wrote in a post on Facebook that this phenomenon previously occurred during a hurricane affecting Acklins Island in the Bahamas in 1936. Hurricane Irma passed through the Bahamas on Friday and struck other Carribean islands late last week. The Category 4 storm made landfall Sunday morning in Florida, where it is expected to move up the western coast of the state. All Rights Reserved.

{"Number":"154","Sentences":"It was a very fast-moving system early in its formation, and it steered rapidly westward by high pressure to its north. Store shelves are empty and gas stations are running out of fuel as residents along Florida's east coast prepare for Hurricane Matthew. This was the third-strongest rapid intensification in a 24-hour period for any Atlantic hurricane on record, trailing only Hurricane Wilma (2005) and Hurricane Felix (2007). But the Caribbean is very warm and very deep, which means there was less cold water to churn. As such, Matthew has been able to sustain itself as a very strong hurricane for a long time. This index takes into account intensity and duration of a hurricane. Hurricane Matthew generated the most ACE of any hurricane in the eastern Caribbean on record. Given the forecast track and intensity of Matthew, it is likely to be one of the highest-generating ACE storms of the past 50 years. As such, Matthew has set some notable landfall records as well. Hurricane Matthew was the first Category 4 hurricane to make landfall in Cuba since Hurricane Ike (2008). The latest National Hurricane Center forecast as well as model guidance indicate that Matthew may last in the Atlantic for another week or more. This would put Matthew in rare territory for hurricane longevity, especially one this late in the season. No hurricanes on record have made landfall north of Miami along the east coast of Florida in October, and as mentioned earlier, no major hurricanes have made landfall since Wilma in 2005. Each of these records has the potential to be broken in the next few days."},

A Category 1 storm has sustained winds of 74-95 mph, while a Category 5 storm has sustained winds of 157 mph or higher. Honduras and Nicaragua were especially hard hit by the hurricane. The hurricane also took a major toll on Nicaragua. In one area alone, Posoltega, more than 2,000 people perished in a huge mudslide. The other Central American nations (Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama) also were affected by Hurricane Mitch, although the death tolls in these locations were significantly lower than Honduras and Nicaragua.

Governors in North and South Carolina warned residents to get out in advance of the storm, which could drop as much as 15 inches of rain. But it's not as if Matthew -- with winds of 115 mph at the center -- didn't cause any damage with its powerful winds. Parts of St. Augustine flooded even as the hurricane was still approaching.

Florida Govs. Rick Scott said officials are particularly concerned about low-lying areas in and around Jacksonville, where there is potential for significant flooding. He said all major roads and interstate highways were open as of late morning, and no major road or traffic issues were reported. In some of the counties that the storm has passed, it appeared that evacuations urged by local officials worked, he said. More than 22,000 people were in shelters statewide, he said. President Barack Obama urged people in coastal northeastern Florida and Georgia to heed the instructions of local officials as Hurricane Matthew approached. Major southern Florida population centers such as Miami and West Palm Beach appeared to have avoided the worst of the storm, as the dangerous eyewall stayed about 100 miles off the coast.
