Patricia and her husband Ron fled their home in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and sought shelter in Lumberton, only to have their car get caught in the floodwaters. Health authorities have warned that Hurricane Matthew has created conditions that are likely to cause an increase in the deadly waterborne cholera virus.

Hurricane Matthew passed by offshore as a Category 3 hurricane bringing heavy winds and minor flooding. Some three million people on the U.S. southeast coast faced an urgent evacuation order Thursday as Hurricane Matthew bore down on Florida. Matthew hit them as a Category Four hurricane but has since been downgraded to three, on a scale of five, by the US National Hurricane Center. The first evacuations were ordered in the United States as coastal residents prepared to escape the approaching monster storm, expected off the East Coast later this week. The dangerous Category 4 storm blew ashore around dawn in Haiti. It unloaded heavy rain as it swirled on toward a lightly populated part of Cuba and the Bahamas. Hurricane Matthew roared into the southwestern coast of the island of Hispaniola with devastating storm conditions as it headed north toward Cuba and the eastern coast of Florida. As the Category 4 hurricane creeps closer, Cuba, in the likely path of destruction, ordered the evacuation of more than 250,000 people from the east of the island. Hurricane Matthew took aim at densely populated Haiti and Jamaica on Monday, packing winds that could sweep away flimsy buildings and bringing torrential rain that could trigger deadly landslides and floods.

Hurricane Matthew roared into the southwestern coast of the island of Hispaniola with devastating storm conditions as it headed north toward Cuba and the eastern coast of Florida. As the Category 4 hurricane creeps closer, Cuba, in the likely path of destruction, ordered the evacuation of more than 250,000 people from the east of the island. Hurricane Matthew took aim at densely populated Haiti and Jamaica on Monday, packing winds that could sweep away flimsy buildings and bringing torrential rain that could trigger deadly landslides and floods.

The storm killed more than 1,000 people in Haiti, and at least 27 in the U.S. - more than half of them in North Carolina. Photo: Vehicles at a business are surrounded by floodwaters from Hurricane Matthew in Lumberton, North Carolina Wednesday, October 12, 2016. People were ordered to evacuate, and officials warned that some communities could be cut off by washed out roads or bridge closures. Thousands of homes have been damaged in North Carolina as a result of the storm and many are still under threat of flooding. Patricia and her husband Ron fled their home in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and sought shelter in Lumberton, only to have their car get caught in the floodwaters. Health authorities have warned that Hurricane Matthew has created conditions that are likely to cause an increase in the deadly waterborne cholera virus. Nearly a week after the storm smashed into southwestern Haiti, some communities along the southern coast have yet to receive any assistance, leaving residents who have lost their homes and virtually all of their belongings struggling to find shelter and potable water. Jeremy Stellhorn carries two-year-old Cathalawa Olivia through flood waters as he rescues residents of a mobile home park inundated by rising river waters in Lumberton, North Carolina after Hurricane Matthew hit the state, October 10, 2016.

Nearly a week after the storm smashed into southwestern Haiti, some communities along the southern coast have yet to receive any assistance, leaving residents who have lost their homes and virtually all of their belongings struggling to find shelter and potable water. Roberto, 32, died when the wall of a church next door to his home fell during Hurricane Matthew. Hurricane Matthew passed by offshore bringing heavy winds and flooding. She and her husband planned to ride out the storm in their store which has been in his family for 90 years. Hurricane Matthew passed by offshore as a Category 3 hurricane bringing heavy winds and minor flooding. Some three million people on the U.S. southeast coast faced an urgent evacuation order Thursday as Hurricane Matthew bore down on Florida. Matthew hit them as a Category Four hurricane but has since been downgraded to three, on a scale of five, by the US National Hurricane Center. The first evacuations were ordered in the United States as coastal residents prepared to escape the approaching monster storm, expected off the East Coast later this week. The dangerous Category 4 storm blew ashore around dawn in Haiti. It unloaded heavy rain as it swirled on toward a lightly populated part of Cuba and the Bahamas. Hurricane Matthew roared into the southwestern coast of the island of Hispaniola with devastating storm conditions as it headed north toward Cuba and the eastern coast of Florida. As the Category 4 hurricane creeps closer, Cuba, in the likely path of destruction, ordered the evacuation of more than 250,000 people from the east of the island. Hurricane Matthew took aim at densely populated Haiti and Jamaica on Monday, packing winds that could sweep away flimsy buildings and bringing torrential rain that could trigger deadly landslides and floods. As the powerful storm churned north, officials in both countries scrambled to protect buildings and move people out of danger zones to shelters. All rights reserved."}
