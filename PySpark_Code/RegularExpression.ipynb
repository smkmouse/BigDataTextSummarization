       "'Other times, we can watch them building from a distance until they fill our entire field of vision, hoping that the plans we put in place actually come together in the moment. Hurricane Irma, barrelling through the Caribbean at upwards of 185mph arrived with plenty of warning, but still, no less unpredictability. Moving and equipping journalists on the ground is expensive and not done lightly, but after a number of days watching the skies, it became clear we should mobilise. As millions were heading north fleeing Florida, our journalists were heading the other way. Breaking off from reporting, he boarded up his home, and made plans for his family to shelter safely. Shelter for us consists of four of us, including my two sons aged 10 and eight, squeezing into a 5ft x 5ft interior closet with no windows, away from exterior walls and doors. My youngest has his teddy bear and some chicken nuggets for comfort. The fact a tornado has actually struck nearby, instead of there just being the possibility of one, is sobering. The family survived a sleepless night and as Miami dodged the eye of the a storm, Richard carried on reporting through the week. Our US chief reporter, Ed Pilkington, has covered most that the world can throw at a journalist, but had not experienced a hurricane first hand. Stocking up on airport sandwiches, he got ready on Friday in his hotel near Miami international airport, for the deluge to come. By Friday afternoon, fuel for the car was his nagging worry as he reported on the tale of two Irmas, in which poor Miami residents stayed behind while the wealthy quit town. By Saturday, weather forecasts suggested the storm was moving west and Ed made the call to drive 100 miles across the state to Naples on the Gulf coast of Florida. A hair-raising drive followed as rains blew sideways and trees littered the deserted highway. When the hurricane reached Florida a day later, Ed was providing words, pictures and video for our live blog and via Twitter. When the storm threatened, they hunkered down. Words and pictures are not the only ways to tell stories today. Josh Holder, who is a developer who makes interactive online stories as part of the Guardian visuals team in London, worked with three other colleagues harnessing technology to show the storm in real time. We decided to add context around the severity of the storm, how well equipped countries were to cope and how it compared to recent storms in the area. Roofs had been torn off, sour seawater had invaded homes and there was no food or water reaching the chain of islands linked to the US mainland by the improbable bridges of highway one. By midweek, with information still only coming in fits and starts from the Caribbean, we ran a report on the catastrophic situation in Havana and Caroline Davies made her way to the British Virgin Islands, the heart of controversy over the preparedness and response of the British government. Even as the death toll rose to 12 in Florida, bringing the total from Irma to 55, the full devastation in the islands is still to become clear. As for the apparent increase in severity of extreme weather events, one key aspect of the way we told the story of hurricanes Irma and Harvey was our decision to grapple with the causes, while others were shy to talk about climate change. Oliver Milman, our New York-based environment correspondent, has examined not only how scientists have warned that higher temperatures have contributed to the severity of tropical storms, but he has also highlighted the consequences of planning failures which have left cities vulnerable to inundation. So Guardian journalists on three continents, using words, pictures and video, processing official and unofficial accounts, brought the deadly power of the hurricane to millions of readers around the world. Hardly. You can never have too many people on the ground witnessing events for themselves and it is, unfortunately, true that more focus goes on those places which are more developed, and easiest to reach and communicate with. Then the lessons to be drawn and vigilance required for reporting on the aftermath are tested, as attention wanders for both audience and newsroom. Even in a dysfunctional seat of government such as Washington DC, billions in aid is unlocked rapidly for national disasters. The restoration of Florida will surely be taken up with greater urgency than restoring the effects of a trail of devastation in the Caribbean.'"

      "'Matthew first made landfall in Haiti as a powerful Category 4 storm on October 4, 2016, with maximum sustained winds of around 145 miles per hour, before heading towards the southeastern United States. The storm killed more than 1,000 people in Haiti, and at least 27 in the U.S. - more than half of them in North Carolina. Photo: Vehicles at a business are surrounded by floodwaters from Hurricane Matthew in Lumberton, North Carolina Wednesday, October 12, 2016. People were ordered to evacuate, and officials warned that some communities could be cut off by washed out roads or bridge closures. Thousands of homes have been damaged in North Carolina as a result of the storm and many are still under threat of flooding. Patricia and her husband Ron fled their home in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and sought shelter in Lumberton, only to have their car get caught in the floodwaters. Health authorities have warned that Hurricane Matthew has created conditions that are likely to cause an increase in the deadly waterborne cholera virus. Nearly a week after the storm smashed into southwestern Haiti, some communities along the southern coast have yet to receive any assistance, leaving residents who have lost their homes and virtually all of their belongings struggling to find shelter and potable water. Jeremy Stellhorn carries two-year-old Cathalawa Olivia through flood waters as he rescues residents of a mobile home park inundated by rising river waters in Lumberton, North Carolina after Hurricane Matthew hit the state, October 10, 2016. Matthew was a monster Category 4 when it slammed into the poorest country in the western hemisphere Tuesday. Lovece rode out the storm as waves took away the room at the back of his home. Nearly a week after the storm smashed into southwestern Haiti, some communities along the southern coast have yet to receive any assistance, leaving residents who have lost their homes and virtually all of their belongings struggling to find shelter and potable water. Roberto, 32, died when the wall of a church next door to his home fell during Hurricane Matthew. Hurricane Matthew passed by offshore bringing heavy winds and flooding. She and her husband planned to ride out the storm in their store which has been in his family for 90 years. Hurricane Matthew passed by offshore as a Category 3 hurricane bringing heavy winds and minor flooding. Some three million people on the U.S. southeast coast faced an urgent evacuation order Thursday as Hurricane Matthew bore down on Florida. Matthew hit them as a Category Four hurricane but has since been downgraded to three, on a scale of five, by the US National Hurricane Center. The first evacuations were ordered in the United States as coastal residents prepared to escape the approaching monster storm, expected off the East Coast later this week. The dangerous Category 4 storm blew ashore around dawn in Haiti. It unloaded heavy rain as it swirled on toward a lightly populated part of Cuba and the Bahamas. Hurricane Matthew roared into the southwestern coast of the island of Hispaniola with devastating storm conditions as it headed north toward Cuba and the eastern coast of Florida. As the Category 4 hurricane creeps closer, Cuba, in the likely path of destruction, ordered the evacuation of more than 250,000 people from the east of the island. Hurricane Matthew took aim at densely populated Haiti and Jamaica on Monday, packing winds that could sweep away flimsy buildings and bringing torrential rain that could trigger deadly landslides and floods. As the powerful storm churned north, officials in both countries scrambled to protect buildings and move people out of danger zones to shelters. All rights reserved.'\n"
